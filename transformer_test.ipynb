              "'Rinzai Zen Buddhism is one of the Chinese five Houses/seven Schools of Zen (Rinzai, Igyou, Soto, Unmon, Hogan) and Gigen RINZAI (? - 867) of Tang was its founder.\\nHe was known as \"RINZAI of Katu (meaning to help wake up the sleeping mind) \" and \"General RINZAI\", and rose to the top of Chinese Zen with his distinctive style.\\nWith its Zen Talks that try to awaken self awareness through study of Koan, it differs from the Silent Zen of the Soto sect, which just does meditation.\\nRinzai School in China\\nAs the name implies, Rinzai School started with its founder Gigen RINZAI at the end of the Tang dynasty, after the anti-Buddhist movement at the Kaishou era.\\nRINZAI was the disciple of Kiun OBAKU; the school grew as a religious movement centered in the province of Hebei, with the support of Changshi WANG of the Hanchin government, but in the confusion that arose around the end of the Tang dynasty, Hebei was at the center of the tumultuous five dynasties and it became difficult to sustain a religious movement.\\nThe central figure around that time was Enshou FUKETSU.\\nIt was in the Northern Song dynasty that Rinzai School became vibrant again, below the gates of Sekiso SOEN, along with Enan OURYU and Houe YOUGI who came from Jiangxi province and created the two main sectes of Rinzai (Ouryu and Yougi), and swept across all of China.\\nWhen it came to the Southern Song dynasty, Soukou DAIE, a disciple of Kokugon ENGO who belonged to the Yougi sect, started the Daikan sect in Zhejiang province, which became a major sect in the Rinzai School.\\nRinzai School in Japan\\nAccording to doctrine, it was brought over to China from India by Bodhidharma, the 28th successor of the 10 disciples (called Kasho) who directly received the teaching (enlightenment) of Siddhartha Gautama.\\nLater the Rinzai school, which achieved the pinnacle of Zen teaching, was brought to Japan in the Kamakura period by Eisai, who went to China to study in the Southern Song period.\\nJapan\\'s Rinzai is one of Zen schools in Japan.\\nIt emphasizes the transmission of enlightenment from teacher to disciple. (Hassu is the disciple who inherited the teaching of the master.)\\nIt calls Sakyamuni the Original Teacher Venerable Sakyamuni Buddha, Bodhidharma the First Ancestor and Great Teacher Bodhidharma, and RINZAI the Founder and Great Teacher Rinzai.\\nIn contrast to the Soto Zen school which spreads through regional clans and the general people, the Rinzai School received support from Samurai families in government, and was esteemed in the politics and culture.\\nLater, the Rinzai School was rebuilt in the Edo period by Master HAKUIN, and continued to be called Hakuin Zen.\\nTraditions\\nTransmission of enlightenment from masters to disciples continues down to the present day (Hassu is the disciple who inherited the teaching of the master).\\nThe important interaction between the master and disciple is called \"a secret in the room\" and is not to be taken out of the master\\'s room and revealed publicly.\\nWhat is extracted from the interactions between a master and disciple, or Zen lecture transcripts that record the actions of a master, is called a Koan (precedent) and various collections have been compiled since the Song dynasty; but enlightenment is not something that can be communicated with words, so when people today try to understand the text, the Koan itself refuses them.\\nHowever, they contain hints that lead people toward enlightenment, and there are a great many Zen books from the beginning down to the present day.\\nAlso since the Song dynasty, the Zen schools changed to a Kannazen style in which masters give lectures using transcripts of Zen talks and the masters became not to display the same majesty as those in the Tang dynasty including Rinzai.\\nAlthough masters choose their successors when they die, the successors have not necessarily attained enlightenment by that time, but that fact is only known to the master and the successor himself.\\nEven if the new master had not attained enlightenment, the disciples would have been able to do so if it is within a few generations from that of the master who gained enlightenment, therefore it is possible to take such a measure.\\nIt is possible for a master to leave behind several new masters, or at his discretion not to leave a successor and bring his line to an end.\\nMany lines have split, and some have disappeared; in this way some of those lines have come down from the 7th century to the present day.\\nEnlightenment\\nThe Zen sects generally emphasize enlightenment over knowledge.\\nEnlightenment in Zen means that all living things realize the inherent buddha nature they possess.\\nFor this reason, masters in the Tang dynasty struggled to enlightenment through much hardship.\\nHowever, they began to devise many techniques for gaining enlightenment from the Song dynasty.\\nThese were systematized so that enlightenment could be gained by performing training such as Zazen (not the same as meditation), Koan (understanding stories that surpass intellectual understanding), Dokyou (reading sutras), or Samu (everyday work) under an already enlightened Zen master.\\nEnlightenment is thought to pass from the master to the disciple as a candle flame passes to a candle that is unlit (called Dentou).\\nThat is not a transmission based on words (logos).\\nFor this reason, it is considered crucial to choose the right Zen master.\\nThat means not just choosing one who has gained enlightenment, but one who fits with one\\'s own personality.\\nActually, it does not mean that an enlightened Zen master instructs and enables someone gain enlightenment.\\nMasters in the Tang dynasty did not learn to get enlightenment from anybody - not to mention Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha, Shakuson), who gained enlightenment without a teacher.\\nWhile it is impossible to define enlightenment with words, words are one of many methods that can describe the boundaries of enlightenment.\\nThat is why, especially after it was brought to Japan, enlightenment has been expressed through artistic expression such as poetry and painting, so that one can get a taste of its aroma.\\nOther than in art, it is also expressed in deportments such as tea ceremony and flower arrangement; and methods to get a taste of the world of enlightenment have also been born.\\nThat is not an intellectual understanding.\\nThe Koan System\\nThe Koan system came together after the Song dynasty, and though they might be fabricated it has made even more enlightenments possible.\\nMost Koan are made up of conversations between a master and disciple, telling the truth of the moment when the disciple gained enlightenment.\\nKoan cannot be received with logical, intellectual understanding, and are stories beyond logic that can be understood only by completely becoming the Koan itself instead of thinking.\\nThe Koan system was established by collecting these Koan stories as a method for leading disciples and was composed of 500 to 1900 Koan stories.\\nKoan system differs according to the master\\'s style.\\nExamples of Koan stories in the beginning.\\n\"Does a dog have buddha-nature?\" \"It does not have.\"\\nAs the background, any Buddhist knows that \"all living things have Buddha-nature.\"\\nThe Sound of One Hand Clapping\\nA disciple has to listen to the sound of clapping with one hand and show that to the master.\\nBy intellectual understanding, it is impossible to clap with one hand and make a sound.\\nSects\\nKenni-ji sect\\nThe sect began when Eisai came back from Southern Song China in 1202.\\nEisai was the first to bring the Zen tradition to Japan.\\nHead temple is Kenni-ji in Kyoto.\\nKenni-ji is the oldest Zen temple in Japan.\\nTofuku-ji sect\\nThe sect began in Kyoto when Benen ENNI returned from Song China in 1236.\\nHead temple is Tofuku-ji in Kyoto.\\nEkei ANKOKUJI, who was a monk and also acted as a diplomat for the Mori clan in the Warring States period, belonged to this school.\\nKencho-ji sect\\nThe sect was established by Douryuu RANKEI in 1253, who was invited from Southern Song China by Tiyori HOJOU, the 5th regent of the Kamakura Shogunate.\\nHead temple is Kencho-ji in Kamakura, founded by Douryuu RANKEI.\\nKencho-ji was the first Zen temple that opened the first pure Zen training hall in Japan, with more than 1,000 monks training there at one time.\\nEnkaku-ji sect\\nThe sect began in Kamakura in 1282 when Sogen MUGAKU was invited from China.\\nHead temple is Enkaku-ji in Kamakura.\\nEnkaku-ji Temple was passed from Sogen MUGAKU to Kennichi KOUHOU and Soseki MUSOU, and was at one time the center of Japanese Zen.\\nFamous Zen masters after the Meiji period include Kousen IMAKITA, Souen SHAKU, and Sougen ASAHINA.\\nDaisetsu SUZUKI who introduced Zen to the West experienced Zen under the two masters, IMAKITA and Souen SHAKU as a lay buddhist.\\nAlso, Soseki NATSUME approached Souen SHAKU and wrote about that experience in The

Castle was a castle in what is now Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City.\\n\"Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle\" is a recent construction that did not exist historically (details to follow).\\nFushimi-jo Castle was originally built by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI for his own residence after retirement.\\nConstruction spanning the reigns of 3 emperors, it was first built on Mt. Shizuki, there called Shizuki Fushimi-jo Castle, and after an earthquake was moved to Mt. Kohata and named Kohata Fushimi-jo Castle.\\nFurthermore, there was the Kohata Fushimi-jo Castle that was built in the days of Toyotomi, and the one that was rebuilt in the Tokugawa days after being destroyed in the battle of Sekigahara.\\nAfter Hideyoshi\\'s death and in accordance with his will, Hideyori TOYOTOMI moved to Osaka-jo Castle; after which Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, leader of the council of 5 elders, moved into this castle and took over government.\\nAlthough it was protected by Ieyasu\\'s vassals, Mototada TORII et alia, during the Battle of Sekigahara, it was attacked and burned by Ishida (the Siege of Fushimi-jo Castle).\\nIt was later rebuilt by Ieyasu; and after it was razed its structures and materials were moved to other locations.\\nAfter it was razed, the location of the citadel was made into a peach orchard and was called Momoyama (Peach Mountain).\\nThat is why Fushimi-jo Castle is typically called Momoyama-jo Castle; and this is the reason why the period of Oda-Toyotomi government is called the \"Azuchi-Momoyama Period\" and the culture of the time called \"Momoyama Culture\".\\nAccording to the account that says the descendants of the family that reclaimed the land are the Yoshimura family, which founded Yoshimura Shuzo, they were the heads of Horiuchi Village, built on the ruins of Fushimi-jo Castle; and it is said that they transferred village land to the Imperial Household in the Meiji Period.\\nHistorically, there was no direct connection.\\nSince the Tokugawa-era keep was moved to Nijo-jo Castle, there is a relatively large number of artifacts left; but there is much that is unclear about the previous keep.\\nThe details are unclear.\\n1592 - In the low-lying hills along the Uji-gawa River where Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI made his home on Mt. Shizuki in retirement, parts of the dismantled Jurakudai were transferred for the building of a castle (Shizuki-jo Castle).\\n1596 - Because it was destroyed in an earthquake, a new castle was built about 500 meters away on Mt. Kohata (present day Mt. Momoyama).\\n1598 - Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI died in this castle\\n1600 - Burned in the Siege of Fushimi Castle\\n1601 - Rebuilt by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA\\n1603 - Was the site of the inauguration of Seii Taishogun\\nFushimi-jo Castle\\'s functions moved to Osaka-jo Castle after the Siege of Osaka, reducing this castle\\'s importance in the eyes of the Edo Shogunate; and it was therefore razed in 1625 after Ieyasu TOKUGAWA\\'s retirement.\\n1964 - Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle Land, an amusement park featuring a mock castle keep \"Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle\", was built on the site of the Fushimi-jo Castle flower garden.\\nJanuary 2003 - Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle Land was closed as part of the restructuring of its parent company, Kintetsu Corporation.\\nFushimi Momoyama-jo Castle escaped destruction thanks to a movement by the people of Kyoto to preserve it as a symbol of Fushimi.\\nNowadays it is maintained as a park.\\nThe City of Kyoto received it at no cost; but the inside is closed to the public because it has deteriorated with age.\\nOctober 2007 - When it was remodeled to look like Osaka-jo Castle for the filming of a period movie, \"Chacha: The Woman from Far Away\", the tiger decorations below the watch tower and Shachihoko were painted gold.\\nWith Toei Films bearing the remodeling cost of around 1 million yen, work to remake it into Osaka-jo Castle continues within the year.\\nWhen the castle was dismantled, the keep and many other buildings were moved to other locations.\\nThe most famous are Nijo-jo Castle and Jojakko-ji Temple; the turrets, castle gate, palace, bath, Tamon Yagura Turret, and earthen walls all were moved to Fukuyama-jo Castle (Bingo Province).\\nBelow is a list of major items that are thought to have been moved and still exist.\\nNote: Among these, the only ones that can be proven are the guest hall of Saikyo-ji Temple, which is the remains from Mt.

This was just before the turmoil of the Onin War (1467 - 1477) (as reported in Inryoken Nichiroku (Inryoken\\'s Diary)), which tells us that Masanobu was already working as a painter in Kyoto by that time.\\nShokoku-ji Temple, as the main temple building of Unchoin, where Masanobu created the screen paintings, is a Zendera temple constructed by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, the third Shogun of the Muromachi shogunate; it is the heart of the Muromachi art world, which produced artist-monks such as Josetsu, Shubun, Sesshu; moreover, in those days Sotan (Sotan OGURI, 1413 - 1481), an artist-monk who was a disciple of Shubun, worked as an official painter.\\nAlthough it is not exactly certain when Masanobu KANO went to Kyoto, whom he studied under and when he became the official painter for the Muromachi shogunate, it is clear (according to certain records) that Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA, the eighth Shogun of the Muromachi shogunate, gave him an important position.\\nIn 1481, a few years after the tumultuous Onin War (1467 - 1477), which had lasted for a decade, Sotan, the official painter for the Muromachi shogunate, died; thus it is thought that Masanobu KANO was appointed as the official painter for the shogunate, succeeding Sotan.\\nSubsequently, Mitsunobu TOSA, of the Yamatoe group (a style of Japanese painting) who was in the postion of Edokoro-azukari (a leader of painters who worked for the Imperial Court) of the Imperial Court, and Masanobu KANO of the Kanga (a Chinese style of painting) group, became two major forces in the art world.\\nIn 1482, the former Shogun, Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA, started the construction of Higashiyama dono (the predecessor of Ginkaku-ji Temple), and Masanobu took charge of the screen paintings.\\nFollowing the death of Yoshimasa in 1490, Masanobu worked for the Hosokawa clan, which had political power at the time.\\nIn this way Masanobu solidified his position in the art world while deepening his relationship with the powers-that-be, and built a foundation for the subsequent prosperity of the Kanoha group.\\nAccording to records, it is known that Masanobu created works in various styles and subjects, including screen paintings and Buddhist paintings; however, all his screen paintings have been lost and the existing works are limited to small paintings such as a hanging scroll.\\nHis painting style was \\'kanga,\\' with ink painting based on the brushwork of Sung and Yuan in China, in contrast to the traditional Yamatoe of his contemporary, Mitsunobu TOSA.\\nAlthough Masanobu lived until age 97, it isn\\'t clear what work he produced during the last 30 years, and it seems he had his heir Motonobu assume the work of painting as he went into retirement.\\nThe second generation, Motonobu KANO (1476 - 1559), who built the basis of prosperity of the Kanoha group, was the heir of Masanobu.\\nHis best existing works include the screen paintings in the hojo of Daisenin, Daitoku-ji Temple (the hojo, or chief priest\\'s room, was completed in 1513) and another one in Reiunin, Myoshin-ji Temple in 1543 (it is widely believed that the screen paintings in Daisenin were not created at the time the hojo was completed but were done in a slightly later period).\\nThe creation of the screen paintings in the hojo of Daisenin was divided among Soami, Motonobu and his brother Yukinobu KANO, depending on the room; accordingly, Motonobu took charge of \"Four Seasons, Flowers and Birds\" in \\'Danna no Ma\\' and \"Founder of the Zenshu sect\" in \\'Ihatsu no Ma.\\'\\n\"Founder of Zenshu sect\" is a typical ink painting, while \"Four Seasons, Flowers and Birds\" is based on ink and shows a new flavor at the same time, as it uses colors only on the flowers and birds.\\nMotonobu strengthened the ties with the Ashikaga Shogun and the Hosokawa clan as the powers-that-be, had numerous disciples and consolidated the basis of the Kanoha as a group of painters.\\nHe accepted orders from court nobles, temples and shrines as well as samurai families; and as for temples and shrines it is known that he created the screen paintings of Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple in Osaka according to the historical record, but this no longer exists.\\nBecause Motonobu referred to himself as \\'Echizen no kami\\' in his later life, he was given a priestly rank called \\'Hogen\\' however, for posterity he has been referred to as \\'Kohogen\\' or \\'Echizen Hogen.\\'\\nThe work is wide-ranging: he created the Engi Emaki of temples and shrines, votive pictures, gilded folding screens in the Yamatoe style, and portraits as well as screen paintings.\\nMotonobu assumed the Yamatoe painting style in Kanga and ink painting (in which his father Masanobu specialized); he specialized in large decorative paintings such as a Fusuma (Japanese sliding door) and a folding screen, and built a foundation for the style of the Kanoha group.\\nHe is also called the founder of the early modern screen paintings as he established the concept of calligraphy painting styles such as Shintai (standard style), Gyotai (semi-cursive style), and Sotai (cursive style).\\nMotonobu had three sons: Munenobu, Hideyori and Naonobu; Naonobu (1519 - 1592); the first, Munenobu, died young, and the third son Naonobu succeeded as the head of family.\\nIt is not clear why their family estate was transferred to the third son Naonobu instead of Hideyori, the second son.\\nNaonobu is widely known as Shoei KANO (his posthumous name), and he was active from the Muromachi period to the Momoyama period.\\nThe huge \"Nirvana\" (six meters long) in Daitoku-ji Temple is his finest work.\\nAlthough he participated in the creation of the screen paintings for the Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple with his father Motonobu as well as in the creation of the screen paintings for the Jukoin, Daitoku-ji Temple with his son Eitoku, he was a less famous artist because his father Motonobu and his son Eitoku were more prominent.\\nEitoku KANO (1543 - 1590), the heir of Shoei, is also called Kuninobu; he is one of the most distinguished painters of the Japanese art world from the Momoyama period.\\nAlthough he created numbers of screen paintings in strict compliance with the plans of the men in power who had survived wild times--including Nobunaga ODA and Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI--these paintings were lost with the buildings, so relatively few of Eitoku\\'s works remain in existence.\\nThe paintings on the partitions in the hojo of Jukoin, Daitoku-ji Temple (which are among his best existing works) were created by Eitoku together with his father Shoei; however, Shoei had Eitoku take charge of Fusumae of the major room in the south front of the hojo, while he took a supporting role.\\nIn the days of feudal society it was a common practice that the head of a family would create Fusumae in the major room, so it is historically believed that, at the time such paintings were created, Shoei had already retired after transferring the family estate to Eitoku, who was a great talent.\\n\"Flowers and Birds\" in Shitchu (the center front room of Hojo) is very highly acclaimed among the screen paintings of Hojo of Jukoin.\\nSubsequently, Eitoku became involved in the creation of the screen paintings in Azuchi Castle Tower, which Nobunaga ODA constructed during the period from 1576 to 1579.\\nHe created screen paintings in the Osaka Castle of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and Jurakudai after Nobunaga died, and in his later years also became involved in creating the screen paintings in the Imperial Palace.\\nThese works were highly acclaimed for their originality in the journals and records of the time, so they would be Eitoku\\'s best works if they existed; however, these paintings were lost with the buildings.\\nAs Eitoku\\'s existing best works, the screen paintings in the hojo of Jukoin, as previously described, are renowned as well as \"Foo dogs, folding screen\" as former imperial property, and \"Urban and suburb of Kyoto, folding screen,\" as handed down through the Uesugi clan; it has also been said that \"Cypress, folding screen\" in the Tokyo National Museum was painted by Eitoku.\\nEitoku excelled at elaborate paintings and monumental paintings, although he had no choice but to paint in the monumental painting style in order to fill a large number of orders for screen paintings.\\nAn elaborate painting is interpreted as a work described in every detail, and monumental painting is interpreted as having a high-minded style.\\nThe Kanoha group also had the most important painters in the early modern ages.\\n\"Viewing Maple Leaves in Takao,\" a designated national treasure, has the seal of \\'Hideyori\\'; it has been said that this was painted by Hideyori KANO (birth and death dates unknown), the second son of Motonobu KANO; however, it is also said that this \\'Hideyori\\' of \"Viewing Maple Leaves in Takao\" is another painter called Hideyori SHINSHO, a grandson of Motonobu.\\nSoshu KANO (1551 - 1601) was a brother of Eitoku, also called Motohide, and worked as an assistant to Eitoku in the creation of the screen paintings in Azuchi Castle.\\nFolding screens and portraits still in existence have been attributed to him.\\nNaganobu KANO (1577 - 1654), another brother of Eitoku, is renowned as the painter of \"Playing Under the Flowering Trees,\" a national treasure.\\nAs painters other than the direct line of the Kano family, Yoshinobu KANO (1552 - 1640), who painted \"Craftspeople, folding screen\" in Kawagoe Kitain, and Naizen KANO (1570 - 1616), who painted \"Hokoku Festival, folding screen\" in Kyoto Toyokuni-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City), are well known.\\nEitoku KANO died at age 48, preceding his father Shoei (Naonobu).\\nEitoku\\'s first son Mitsunobu KANO (c. 1565 - 1608) and second son Takanobu KANO (1571 - 1618) succeeded him.\\nMitsunobu created the screen paintings in the Reception Hall of Kangakuin, Onjo-ji Temple; in contrast to Eitoku he specialized in delicate painting in the Yamatoe style.\\nSuch a style of painting might not have suited the public taste at the time, and the early modern essays on paintings, including \"Honchogashi,\" generally put a low value on Mitsunobu.\\nAfter the death of the Kano ｆamily head Mitsunobu, his brother Takanobu led the Kanoha group because his son Sadanobu KANO (1597 - 1623) was only 12 years of age.\\nUnder the feudal system, the family line of Sadanobu, Mitsunobu\\'s first son, was supposed to be the head of family; however, Sadanobu died without an heir at the age of just 27, so after that the legitimacy of the Kano family was the descendant of Takanobu till the end of the Edo period.\\nTakanobu had three sons--Morinobu (Tanyu 1602 - 1674), Naonobu KANO (1607 - 1650) and Yasunobu KANO(1613 - 1685)--and they respectively became the earliest ancestor of the Kajibashi Kano family, Kobikicho Kano family and Nakabashi Kano family.\\nAlthough the youngest son, Yasunobu, succeeded as the Kano head of family as an adopted son of Sadanobu (mentioned above), the most renowned painter was Morinobu (also known as Tanyu).\\nMorinobu later became a priest and called himself Tanyusai; as a painter he is known as Tanyu KANO.\\nHe eventually moved to Edo and solidified the position of the Kanoha group in the art world more as the official painter of the Edo shogunate.\\nTanyu exercised his painting talent from childhood; in 1612, he met Ieyasu TOKUNAGA in Sunpu at the age of 11 and obtained a residence in Edo Kajibashi Mongai in 1621, subsequent to which he worked based in Edo and energetically created screen paintings in castles and large temples.\\nAmong Tanyu\\'s works, the screen paintings in the Edo and Osaka castles were lost with the buildings, but the screen paintings (ink paintings) in Jorakuden of Nagoya Castle are existent, having avoided an air raid during World War II because they had been removed from the building and evacuated; additionally, the screen paintings in Ninomaru Palace of Nijo Castle and the hojo of Daitoku-ji Temple are among his best existent works.\\nHe created various kinds of works, including hanging rolls, picture scrolls and folding screens, as well as these large paintings.\\nHe created the screen paintings in Ninomaru Palace of Nijo Castle when he was young (25 years of age), and they showed dynamism in Eitoku\\'s style; however, the screen paintings in Daitoku-ji Temple, which he created later in his life (mainly with ink and water), display a calm approach with abundant use of blank space.\\nHe had works in the Yamatoe style in picture scrolls and folding screens as well.\\nTanyu emphasized sketches and the copying of ancient paintings; consequently, he left numerous sketch books and reproduction books.\\nMany of Tanyu\\'s copies of ancient paintings (called \\'Tanyu Reduction\\') are existent, which are now part of museums and collections around the nation, and they include many copies of ancient paintings whose originals are now lost, so they are valuable as data for the study of Japanese art history.\\nThe Kanoha group during the Edo period was a huge painting group comprised of a consanguinity group mainly with the head family of the Kano family and numerous disciples around the nation, thus comprising a hierarchy.\\nThey are clearly ranked: under the most prestigious four families (called \\'inner court painters\\') there are about 15 families less prestigious called \\'outer court painters\\' and then the \\'Machi Kano painters\\' who catered to the demands of townspeople instead of the Imperial Court or temples and shrines; and consequently their influence spread throughout the nation.\\nThe powers of the time sought the stability and continuity of feudal society, and the paintings for public places such as Edo Castle were supposed to be painted in the style of traditional painting examples; they were not intended to be unique.\\nIn order to create numbers of screen paintings, one must work in a group with all the disciples; therefore, in order to make group work easier, the ability to learn from painting examples was valued more than one\\'s individuality as a painter.\\nIn this respect it is undeniable that the paintings of the Kanoha group lack individuality and originality.\\nIt is said that the inner court painters ranked with Hatamoto and were allowed \\'audience\\' with the Shogun as well as belting on a sword, which implies a high status.\\nThe four families of the inner court painters are the Kajibashi family, with lineage of Tanyu (the first son of Takanobu KANO); the Kobikicho family (called Takekawa-cho family at the time), with lineage of Naonobu (the second son of Takanobu); the Nakabashi family with lineage of Yasunobu (the third son of Takanobu); and the Hamacho family, with lineage of Minenobu KANO (1662 - 1708) (Minenobu is the second son of Tsunenobu KANO, the first son of Naonobu KANO).\\nBecause Tanyu had no child, he adopted Toun (Masunobu KANO 1625 - 1694), the son of Ryujo GOTO, a swordsmith.\\nLater, Morimasa KANO (1653 - 1718) who was his biological son (born after Tanyu turned 50) succeeded him, but subsequently this lineage had no distinguished painter.\\nAmong the numerous disciples of Tanyu, Morikage KUSUMI (birth and death dates unknown), the creator of \"Enjoying the Cool of the Evening Under the Moonflower Trellis,\" is renowned.\\nMorikage was for some reason expelled from the Kanoha group; he worked in the Kanazawa area later, but his records aren\\'t completely clear.\\nAs stated previously, the head family of Kano was succeeded by the Nakabashi Family of Yasunobu, a brother of Tanyu.\\nTokinobu KANO (1642 - 1678), a son of Yasunobu, died in his thirties, and his son Ujinobu KANO (1675 - 1724) succeeded the family estate; however, subsequently this lineage had no distinguished painter.\\nItcho HANABUSA (1652 - 1724), who was popular based on his sophisticated painting style, was a disciple of Yasunobu.\\nThe family that produced relatively prominent painters until the end of the Edo period among the four families of the inner court painters is the Kobikicho family, of Naonobu\\'s lineage.\\nThis family line produced Tsunenobu KANO (1636 - 1713), the heir of Naonobu, and Tsunenobu\\'s sons, Chikanobu KANO (1660 - 1728) and Minenobu KANO (1662 - 1708).\\nMinenobu won the favor of the Shogun Ienobu TOKUGAWA, and he later gained independence as \\'Hamacho family,\\' which was ranked as one of the inner court painter families.\\nBesides them, Koi KANO (date of birth unknown - 1636) was not related by blood to the Kano family but, along with his brothers, was a master of Tanyu; he was allowed to use the surname of Kano due to his achievements, and he worked for the Kishu Tokugawa family.\\nMeanwhile, a group called \\'Kyo Kano\\' remained active in Kyoto, and Sanraku KANO (1559 - 1635), a disciple of Eitoku KANO, was the pillar of the group.\\nSanraku was from the Kimura clan in Omi, the vassal of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI; his original name was Mitsuyori KIMURA.\\nHis best works are \"Peonies\" and \"Red and White Plum Trees\" in the main house of Kyoto Daikaku-ji Temple, and they have colorful and decorative pictures on a golden base.\\nSansetsu KANO (1589/90 - 1651), the husband of Sanraku\\'s daughter, created the screen paintings in Tenkyuin, Myoshin-ji Temple as well as some paintings of folding screens, which are still in existence.\\nHe had a distinctive painting style unique among painters of the Kanoha group, such as distinct shapes of trees and rocks, as well as the completeness of detail.\\nThe essay on paintings made by Sansetsu and edited by his son Eino KANO (1631 - 1697) is entitled \"Honchogashi,\" the first full-fledge painting history book by a Japanese.\\nThe Kobikicho family produced Michinobu KANO (Michinobu EISENIN (1730 - 1790)), Korenobu KANO (Korenobu YOSENIN (1753 -

1888), a leading figure of the Japanese art world during the early Meiji period, like Gaho HASHIMOTO (born in Kawagoe, 1835 - 1908), was a disciple of Tadanobu KANO (Tadanobu SHOSEN\\'IN 1823 - 1880), the next generation of SEISENIN.\\nBoth Hogai and Gaho were from painter families of the Kanoha group.\\nThe historical role of the Kanoha group as a professional painter group finished as its patron, the Edo shogunate, ended.\\nPersonal information of Emperor SHIRAKAWA\\nEmperor SHIRAKAWA (7th July 1053 - 24th July 1129) was the 72nd Emperor.\\nSHIRAKAWA came to power on the 18th January 1073 and reigned until 5th anuary 1087.\\nHis posthumous name was Sadahito.\\nSHIRAKAWA was the first son of Emperor Go-Sanjo who had little maternal relationship with the Fujiwara Five Regent Houses, and his mother, Nyogo, FUJIWARA no Moshi/Shigeko was from Fujiwara Kaninryu, the daughter of Chunagon FUJIWARA no Kinnari, and the adopted daughter of Togu Daibu FUJIWARA no Yoshinobu.\\nHis half sister was Princess Tokushi/Atsuko (Empress of Horikawa)\\nGenealogy\\nWhen he was young, he and his father were snubbed due to their background, but after his father was enthroned in 1068 (Jiryaku 4), he was proclaimed a Shinno (Imperial prince) and became Imperial Prince Sadahito.\\nIn 1069 he became Crown Prince, and became an Emperor three years later, when he was twenty years old.\\nA Kanpaku was assigned, but SHIRAKAWA attempted to rule directly like his father had done, after his father, the retired Emperor, died of illness in 1070 (Jiryaku 5), and also attempted to regulate the Shoen(manor) system thereby trying to weaken the influence of the Regent/Kanpaku Houses.\\nGo-Sanjo-in and Go-Sanjo-in\\'s mother, Yomeimon-in, wished for SHIRAKAWA\\'s younger half brother, Prince Sanehito (Heian period) and then Sanehito`s younger brother Prince Sukehito to succeed to the throne, and upon abdication to SHIRAKAWA, Prince Sanehito was decided to become Crown Prince.\\nSHIRAKARA repelled against this and later Prince Sanehiro died from illness in 1085 (Otoku 2).\\nAs a result, in November, 1086 (Otoku 3), SHIRAKAWA proclaimed his own eight year old son, Prince Taruhito (73rd Emperor Horikawa) to be the Crown Prince instead of Prince Sukehito and SHIRAKAWA abdicated immediately.\\nRetired Emperor SHIRAKAWA, who became Daijo Tenno, acted as the guardian of the young Emperor, and ruled personally as Shirakawa-in, and this style of government became known as Insei system (cloistered style).\\nThrough such system, although the Sessho and Kampaku offices continued, they did not have actual power to rule the government.\\nSHIRAKAWA continued to have exert power even after Emperor Horikawa turned twenty years old and he strengthened his despotic position by appointing aids from the Juryro and Samurai class.\\nThe Samurai soldiers were assigned to such posts as the \"Hokumen no bushi\" which was newly established to protect the retired Emperor.\\nSHIRAKAWA was a strict Buddhist and he became a Cloistered Emperor with posthumous Buddhist name of Yukan after the death of his daughter in 1096 (Kaho 3).\\nSHIRAKAWA ordered the building of many temples and Buddhist statues including the Hossho-ji Temple, and he took advantage of getting finance from Juryo.\\nAfter Emperor Horikawa died, SHIRAKAWA ruled using a cloistered government for forty three years through three generations of young Emperors, until he died on 24th July 1129 (7th July Taiji 4), and he supported both his grandson 74th Emperor Toba and his great grandson 75th Emperor Sutoku.\\nThis is called \"Chiten no kimi\".\\nThe Cloistered Emperor Shirakawa had supreme power, but it was said he mented that, he has no control over the following three things: 1. Waters of the Kamo River (tributary of the Yodo River)(due to its flow and frequent flooding); 2. Dice used in sugoroku (different from current sugoroku, close to western backgammon), which was popular way of gambling at that time, with spots on the dice selecting winners/losers; and 3. Yamaboshi (monk soldiers from Mt. Hie Enryaku-ji Temple), which show that SHIRAKAWA had absolute control apart from these three things.\\nSHIRAKAWA is also known for many relationships with women and the rumor that Emperor Sutoku and TAIRA no Kiyomori may be SHIRAKAWA\\'s illegitimate sons, was widely spread and believed at the time.\\nEmpress, FUJIWARA no Kenshi/Kataiko (1057-1084) - the daughter of MINAMOTO no Akifusa and adopted daughter of FUJIWARA no Morozane\\nPrince Atsufumi (1074-1077)\\nPrincess Teishi/Yasuko (Ikuhoumon-in), (1076-1096), Saigu\\nPrincess Reishi/Yoshiko (1078-1144), Saiin\\nPrince Taruhito (Emperor Horikawa) (1079-1107)\\nPrincess Shinshi/Yoshiko(Tsuchimikadosaiin) (1081-1156)\\nNyogo:FUJIWARA no Doshi/Michiko (1042-1132) was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Yoshinaga\\nPrincess Yoshiko (Rokkaku Saigu).(1076-1131)\\nNaishinosuke: FUJIWARA no Keishi/Tsuneko, was the fourth daughter of FUJIWARA no Tsunehira, and later became wife of FUJIWARA no Kinsada\\nPrince Kakugyoho (1075-1105) Ninna-ji Monzeki\\nMINAMOTO no Moroko (1070-1148) was the daughter of MINAMOTO no Akifusa and later became wife of FUJIWARA no Tadazane.\\nPrince Kakuhoho (1092-1153) - Ninna-ji Monzeki\\nMINAMOTO no Raishi/Tomoko was the daughter of MIINAMOTO no Yoritsuna\\nPrincess Miyako (1090-?), Kamo Saiin\\nDaughter of FUJIWARA no Suezane\\nKasuga-dono - was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Morokane and later became wife of FUJIWARA no Munemichi\\nPrince Shoeho (1094-1137)\\nBizen was the daughter of MINAMOTO no Arimune\\nEngyo (1128-?)\\nDaughter of MINAMOTO no Masanaga\\nGyokei (1101-1165) - Daisojo\\nGion no nyogo\\nSister of Gion no nyogo - Later on she became wife of TAIRA no Tadamori\\nRo no onkata - was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Michisue and later on became wife of FUJIWARA no Saneyoshi\\nUreshiki (Kamo nyogo) - the daughter of Sigesuke KAMOAGATANUSHI\\nIwaiwo (Kamonyogo) - daughter of igesuke KAMOAGATANUSHI\\nThe Tsuigo of Shirakawa-in comes from the name of the residence from which he conducted his cloistered rule after abdicating the throne (sometimes Tsuigo is considered to be a type of pothumous name, however strictly speaking these are two different names).\\nSHIRAKAWA was also named Rokujotei.\\nHe was named Emperor SHIRAKAWA in and after Taisho period.\\nEnkyu\\nEiho\\nOtoku\\nThe Emperor was entombed in Jobodaijin no misasagi located in Takedajobodaiincho, Fushimi district, Kyoto City.\\nNear this Jobodaiin, there is another poossible place that SHIRAKAWA was entombed in, which is regulated by the Imperial Household Agency as Ryobo sankouchi.\\nAll the past Emperors are enshrined in Koreiden, one of the Three Palace Sanctuaries.\\nEmperor Shirakawa initially wished to be buried after his death, and often mentioned this to his people, but he suddenly ordered to be cremated, when he learnt that the body of FUJIWARA no Moromichi, who was buried, was in the danger of being humiliated by monk soldiers of Kofuku-ji Temple, who were known to be opposed to Moromichi when Moromichi was alive, and planned to attack and open Moromichi\\'s grave.\\nIt is said the Emperor\\'s body was cremated in the Kita district, Kyoto City at a crematorium, monument of which still exists near the Kinkaku Elementary School.\\nKei MIKAWA \"Cloistered Emperor Shirakawa – The Emperor who started Cloistered Rule\" published by Japan Broadcast Publishing Association in 2003.

They held the lordship of Karoku, an area of land that yielded 2,000 koku of rice in the Edo era and 3,000 koku later on, until the Meiji era.\\nSetsuko, the fourth daughter of the duke Michitaka KUJO, who was Hisatada KUJO\\'s firstborn, became empress to the Emperor Taisho (Empress Teimei).\\nConflict over legitimate blood between the Kujo and Ichijo families\\nMichiie KUJO lost the legitimate heir, Norizane KUJO, and the second son, Yoshizane KUJO, was practically repudiated.\\nMichiie gave Tadaie KUJO, Norizane\\'s son and Michiie\\'s grandchild, to be the legitimate heir, a shobunjo (a kind of will) to give instructions that documents such as diaries (which were the most important heritage for a court noble at the time) should be inherited by the Ichijo Family, but that the head of a family who controls the family temples such as Tofuku-ji Temple should first be inherited by Sanetsune ICHIJO, the third son of Michiie, then by Tadaie KUJO, a child of the eldest son of Michiie, and later by either descendant of the Kujo Family or the Ichijo Family who took the highest-ranking official position (head of a clan).\\nIn accordance with Michiie\\'s will, Sanetsune ICHIJO\\'s descendant inherited the position as head of the family after Michiie died.\\nThereafter, the predominance of the Ichijo Family was maintained for over 100 years, whereby the position of the Ichijo Family as legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu (Kujo family line) was well established.\\nWhen Tsunemichi ICHIJO died in 1365 (the Hokucho period), during the Muromachi era, Tsunenori KUJO--who had gained the second position of power after the Ichijo Family--made an appeal to the Emperor Gokogon that Fusatsune ICHIJO, a son of Tsunemichi, had fraudulently identified himself as the head of family.\\nAt that time, primogeniture was becoming the common practice, and Tsunenori claimed that according to primogeniture the Kujo Family, the descendant of the eldest son of Michiie, should inherit the family estate.\\nFusatsune ICHIJO argued against Tsunenori, stating that just because an ancestor of the Kujo Family was the firstborn child it did not mean the Kujo Family was the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu, and that because Michiie KUJO gave the family estate to Sanetsune ICHIJO, the Tokado-bunko (Gonnjo-moromichi-ki) (Gonijo-moromichi record), Gyokuyo (Kanezane KUJO\\'s diary) and Gyokuzui (Michiie KUJO\\'s diary)) and the document endorsing the political authority of Kujo-ryu Sekkan-ke, a regent family, were inherited by the ICHIJO Family; whereas Tsunenori KUJO asserted that measures to give inheritance to Sanetsune were taken just because Tadaie KUJO was in infancy, and that if Norizane KUJO had lived longer it would not have happened.\\nTunenori further asserted that Tadaie KUJO was named as the receiver of the shobunjo (executor of the will) and the land patent of the premise of Tofuku-ji Temple had been inherited by the Kujo Family because the Kujo was the legitimate blood.\\nConsidering the political position of the Kujo Family at that time, the emperor gave Rinji to the Kujo Family on November 29 (lunar calendar), in the same year giving the verdict that the will of Michiie was no more than the inheritance of the head of a family by the head of a clan and that the Kujo and Ichijo families, both having the qualification, were on equal footing as legitimate blood.\\nThe Ichijo Family was the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu during the Kamakura era, but after the middle Muromachi period the position of the Kujo Family was elevated and the Ichijo and Kujo families were considered to be the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu.\\nThe Kujo Family started inheriting the Matsudono Family\\'s fiefdom after the Middle Edo period; thus the Kujo possessed the largest Kokudaka, lived in a huge house and claimed to be the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu.\\nKanezane KUJO (1149-1207)\\nYoshitsune KUJO (1169-1206)\\nMichiie KUJO (1193-1252)\\nNorizane KUJO (1210-1235)\\nYoritsune KUJO (1218-1256)\\nYoritsugu KUJO (1239-1256)\\nHisatada KUJO (1798-1871)\\nOld Kujo-tei was in the southwest area of the present-day Kyoto Gyoen.\\nToday only the garden remains, on the basis of maintenance.\\nItsukushima-jinja Shrine, which was then called Chinju-sha, still exists on the island of the garden pond (KUJO-ike), and a simple but elegant tearoom called Shusui-tei is found near the pond.\\nThe major buildings (such as the main building) were transferred to Kujo-tei in Tokyo in accordance with the order issued during the early Meiji era, and were recently donated by the Kujo Family to the Tokyo National Museum, which was named Kujo-kan.\\nYamashiro no Kuni, located in Kinai, was one of the administrative province (Ryoseikoku).\\nIt was situated in the southern part of present day Kyoto.\\nIt was also called Joshu (unusually it is also alled Sanshu) or Yoshu.\\nIn the Engishiki, it is ranked as Kokushi-kuni tokyu (a Kokushi (official) governing province).\\n\"Yamashiro\" was written as 山代 in ancient times, and in the 7th century, the province (kuni) was founded with the name written as 山背国.\\nOn November 8, 794 (Enryaku 13), when the capital was named Heian-kyo (Heian Palace), the Emperor Kammu changed the second letter of the province\\'s name to 山城国\\nBased on the writings of \"mokkan\"－strips of wood used for writing during the Heijo-kyo (Heijo Palace) period, the notations of Yamashiro no Kuni as 山代国 and 山背国 seem to have coexisted with 山城国.\\nAccording to Wamyo Ruijusho, the provincial government office (Kokufu) was situated at the Kaya Imperial Villa (Kaya Detached Palace).\\nOn the other hand, it is recorded as \"Otokuni-gun (Otokuni District), Fu (Office)\" in Shugaisho.\\nIn the colophon and afterward titled \"Keicho-two Enirinshi\" of Setsuyoshu (proofed by Ekirin) it is also recorded as \"Otokuni-gun (Otokuni District), Fu (Office).\"\\nAs for Shugosho (governor\\'s office), at first, the mansion of the Gokenin of Kyoto Shugo (Kyoto governor) was designated because the person holding the post of Kyoto Shugo concurrently took charge of Yamashiro Province\\'s Shugo.\\nLater, Rokuhara Tandai held the post of the Province Shugo, and therefore, the office (Shugosho) was moved to Rokuhara.\\nIn Muromachi period, the Yamashiro Province was divided along the Uji River into three upper districts and five lower districts;

10 in the KONDO squad and 24 in the HIJIKATA squad (There are different views on the number. cf. List of Soldiers Involved).\\nThe HIJIKATA squad, a part of the Shinsen-gumi, searched Nawate Street from Yasaka Shrine, while the KONDO squad searched Kiyamachi Street across the Sanjo Bridge.\\nAt the end of the search, the KONDO squad found radical nationalists who were having a meeting at Ikedaya.\\nA few members of the KONDO squad attacked them and got into a battle in the middle of the night.\\nFour of the members - Isami KONDO, Soji OKITA, Shinpachi NAGAKURA, and Heisuke TODO - first attacked the 20-some radical nationalists while the rest shored up the perimeter.\\nSome ronins frantically attacked Hayatarou ANDO, Eisuke OKUZAWA and Kakuzaemon NITTA who guarded the back door, and succeeded to escape.\\nOKUZAWA died in the attack, and ANDO and NITTA died a month later.\\nOKITA went inside the building and fought hard, but collapsed during the battle and withdrew from it.\\nSome accounts say that this was because of a tuberculosis-related blood spitting, but there is a lot of doubt and it is not certain.\\nThen, a sword hit the forehead of TODO on the first floor when sweat caused his helmet to slip out of place, and he withdrew from the battle.\\nAlthough there were KONDO and NAGAKURA only at one point, the arrival of the HIJIKATA squad tilted the odds in favor of the Shinsen-gumi and achieved a result of nine people killed and four arrested.\\nAizu and Kuwana clans arrived there to support them after the battle.\\nHIJIKATA would not let them anywhere near, to ensure that they could not take credit.\\nAlthough some of the radical nationalists escaped from the battle, the next morning more than 20 people were arrested by carrying out clearing operations with Aizu, Kuwana, and other clans.\\nThe sweep of the city turned violent, and there were 5 immediate deaths among the Aizu clan, four among the Hikone clan, and two among the Kuwana clan.\\nAt noon of the following day, the Shinsen-gumi returned to their base in Mibu Village. (If they had returned to their base at night, they might have fallen into an ambush, so they took a rest in the city until dawn.)\\nIt is said that the roadside was crowded with onlookers.\\nThe name of the Shinsen-gumi, which succeeded in preventing the plot to burn down the imperial palace, became famous throughout the land.\\nThe \"revere the emperor, expel foreigners\" faction, on the other hand, took a big blow with the deaths of such important activists as Toshimaro YOSHIDA, Kichima KITAZOE, Teizo MIYABE, Matajiro OTAKA, Junjiro ISHIKAWA, Matsusuke SUGIYAMA and Jusuke MATSUDA. (They were later called the \"Seven Martyrs\" by the new government.)\\nKogoro KATSURA (later Takayoshi KIDO) should have been there too, but he arrived earlier and then went back to the base to wait a while. His life had been spared because the incident occurred before he came back.\\nBeginning with this incident, the Choshu clan fell under the influence of zealots and later came to Kyoto and raised the Kinmon rebellion on July 19 (in the old calendar).\\nIt has been said that the Ikedaya Incident delayed the Meiji Restoration by a year. There is also another opinion that it sped up the Restoration by stirring up the \"revere the emperor, expel foreigners\" faction.\\nAuthor Ryotaro SHIBA\\'s interpretation is that the Meiji Restoration led by the four major clans of Satsuma, Choshu, Tosa, and Bizen would never have happened without this incident.\\nThe following Shinsen-gumi soldiers fought in the Ikedaya Incident.

like the moon goes behind a cloud at a blow\\' was selected for \"Ogura Hyakunin isshu (One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets).\"\\nShe was from the Fujiwara clan, and her name as a court lady was \\'Fuji Shikibu (Murasaki Shikibu).\\'\\nShe acquired the sobriquet of \\'Murasaki\\' from the name of the heroine \\'Murasaki no Ue\\' of \"The Tale of Genji,\" and \\'Shikibu\\' refers to her father\\'s position as Shikibutaijo (Aide of Ceremonials).\\nMurasaki Shikibu\\'s real name is unknown, but it is assumed that she was the \\'FUJIWARA no Kaoriko/Takako/Koshi,\\' who became shoji (ranked) on January 29, 1007, which was described in \\'Mido Kanpakuki (FUJIWARA no Michinaga\\'s diary).\\'\\nHowever this view is generally based on the other assumptions, which are said to contain errors in the process of making inferences, so it remains a matter of conjecture.\\nAlso, her dates of birth and death are unknown, but it is suggested that she was about 30 years old in 1008, based on historical materials and her works; by counting backwards from that age, she would have been born around 979 and died around 1016.\\nTradition has it that she liked sardines, which was unusual for aristocracy, but this episode is based on a story of Izumi Shikibu in \\'Sarugenji no soshi (The Sarugenji Book),\\' so it seems to have been made up by someone at a later date.\\nShe was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tametoki, governor of Echigo Province, and her mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tamenobu from Settsu Province, but she lost her mother when she was little.\\nFUJIWARA no Nobunori was her brother by a different father, and apparently she also had an older sister.\\nFUJIWARA no Sadakata, Sanjo Udaijin (Sanjo minister of the right), and FUJIWARA no Kanesuke, Tsutsumi Chunagon (vice-councilor of state), were her paternal great grandfathers, and she had many relatives who were known as talented writers.\\nThere are many anecdotes stating that, since her childhood, she had had more talent for reading Chinese classics than women were required to have in those days.\\nIt is generally considered that she wrote both \"The Tale of Genji,\" which consists of 54 chapters, and \"Murasaki Shikibu Diary,\" which was about her days in service to the Imperial Court, as well as \"Collection of Murasaki Shikibu\\'s Works.\"\\nHer father, FUJIWARA no Tametoki, obtained employment as a reader in Togu (the palace of the Crown Prince) while in his thirties, and when the Crown Prince became Emperor Kazan he was promoted to the post of kurodo (Chamberlain) and then to Shikibutaijo; however, when the Emperor became a priest, he lost his job.\\nTen years later, as a consequence of dedicating a poem to Emperor Ichijo, he became a governor of Echizen Province.\\nMurasaki Shikibu, during her childhood, spent two years in the place of her father\\'s assignment.\\nIn about 998, she married a governor of Yamashiro Province FUJIWARA no Nobutaka, who was old enough to be her father; in 999 she bore him a daughter, FUJIWARA no Kataiko/Kenshi, but this marriage life didn\\'t last long because Nobutaka died soon afterward.\\nIn December 29 (according to the lunar calendar) of 1005, she began serving the Empress of Emperor Ichijo FUJIWARA no Shoshi/Akiko (the oldest daughter of FUJIWARA no Michinaga, and later given the name of the Retired Emperor Jotomonin) as a court lady-cum-tutor, and she served the Empress at least until 1011.\\nThere is a poem created by ISE no Taifu, \\'Some time ago, double-flowered cherry trees bloomed in the colorful capital of Nara; today they bloom in Kuju Castle in this capital of Kyo, as they did before,\\' which was collected in \"Shika Wakashu (Collection of Poetry)\"; the poem was written in dedication to the Empress along with yaezakura (double cherry blossoms) presented to the Imperial Court; however, according to \"ISE no Taifu shu (Private Collection)\" it was supposed to be a duty of Murasaki Shikibu, but she delegated the duty to a newcomer, Taifu.\\nThe last description about Murasaki Shikibu appears in \"Shoyuki,\" the diary of FUJIWARA no Sanesuke, dated May 25 (lunar calendar) 1014, saying that \\'as \"a daughter of Tametoki, who was a governor of Echigo Province,\" she conveyed a message from the wife of the Retired Empress Shoshi to Sanesuke.\\'\\nTherefore it is widely believed that she died between 1012 and 1016, in the reign of Emperor Sanjo, but some people disagree.\\nAlso, tradition has it that Murasaki Shikibu\\'s grave can be found at Murasaki no Nishigoshoden-cho (Horikawa Kitaoji Kudaru, West side), Kita Ward, Kyoto City.\\nToday, the Bank of Japan\\'s D-note of 2,000 yen has a portrait of Murasaki Shikibu and a part of \"The Tale of Genji Emaki (picture scroll)\" on its back side.\\nHer name appeared in the great historical figures calendar of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (=UNESCO), and she was the only Japanese to be thus enrolled.\\nYou can read some comments about her contemporary famous court ladies.\\nAbove all, a comment about Sei Shonagon, the author of The Pillow Book, is the most famous (the following is a free translation):\\nSei Shonagon is a jerk who acts proudly. Chinese characters, she blots in a wise, have full of mistakes.\\'(\"Murasaki Diary\" Kurokawabon (type of manuscript))\\n\"Will the life of a person with such insincerity be better in the future?\" (from \"Murasaki Diary\" Kurokawabon)\\nThese comments are quite severe and can be said to be almost backbiting.\\nThese descriptions have been brought into conversation with various conjectures and curiosity (Murasaki Shikibu was jealous of the talent of Sei Shonagon, etc.) up until recently.\\nHowever, these two people were distant in age and served the Imperial Court in different times (nearly a decade), so they seem not to have known each other.\\nShe wrote some positive comments about her contemporary female poets, Izumi Shikibu (\\'her behavior is not good, but her poems are excellent,\\' etc.), and Akazome-emon.\\nEmperor Ichijo had a court lady read aloud \"The Tale of Genji,\" at which he praised the author, saying she must have been an eager reader of Nihongi (according to \"Shoku-Nihongi (Continuation of Chronicles of Japan),\" whereby Nihongi refers to \"Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan)\"; thus some people claim that \"Nihongi\" in this context means \"Nihonshoki\").\\nBecause of this, Murasaki Shikibu was given the nickname \\'Nihongi no Otsubone,\\' but it is widely thought that the Emperor\\'s words brought her into ridicule because it was felt that a woman shouldn\\'t read Chinese classics, and she was distressed by the words.\\nMurasaki Diary and \"Eiga monogatari (A Tale of Flowering Fortunes),\" the latter of which has some descriptions common to the Murasaki Diary, states that Michinaga visited her chamber at night.\\nAdditionally, \"Various Japanese Family Trees\" (\"New Compilation of Various Japanese Family Trees Analogy\") says that \\'a court lady of Jotomonin, a poet, Murasaki Shikibu, an author of The Tale of Genji, or Masatada\\'s granddaughter, Tametoki\\'s daughter, mistress of Michinaga, the chief adviser to the Emperor,\\' which clearly shows that she was a mistress of Michinaga, but the true relationship between them is unknown.\\nMurasaki Shikibu Diary Ekotoba (explanation on a picture scroll) (National treasure) Fujita Museum of Art\\nAcademy of Murasaki Shikibu\\nThe purpose of the Academy of Murasaki Shikibu is to promote classical literature as represented by \"The Tale of Genji\"; the academy was established on June 4, 1932 by Tsukuru FUJIMURA (president), who was the head of the Department of Japanese Literature, Faculty of Letters at Tokyo Imperial University; Senichi HISAMATSU (vice-president), a professor of Japanese literature at Tokyo Imperial University; and Kikan IKEDA (chairperson), a junior assistant of the Japanese literature study room at Tokyo Imperial University.\\nSince January 1964, the office has been set in Japanese Literature Department lab, School of Literature, Tsurumi University, which is located in Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture.\\nThe current president is Ken AKIYAMA.\\nThe academy holds lecture meetings, supports a play based on \"The Tale of Genji\" and publishes the following periodicals:\\nThe bulletin \"Murasaki\" was published every month before World War II (August 1934 - June 1944), and has been published annually after the war era (since 1962).\\nThe collection of academic papers \"Studies and Data Traditional Literature Article\" has been published by Musashinoshoin annually since June 1969.\\nTakauji ASHIKAGA (1305-58) was a general from the late Kamakura period to the Northern and Southern Courts period.\\nHe was the 1st Seii Taishogun of the Muromachi Shogunate.\\nTakauji was a descendant of the Genji clan.\\nHe was the 1st son of Sadauji ASHIKAGA, who was a descendant in the direct line of the Ashikaga clan, which was the powerful family in Kawachi Genji.\\nIn his early years, he was given the name Takauji by the regent Takatoki HOJO.\\nIn 1333, when the Emperor Go-Daigo had raised an army at Mt. Senjosan in Hoki Province, Takauji, the powerful vassal of the Kamakura shogunate, was sent to Kyoto leading the main armies of the shogunate to put down the rebellion, but he switched sides and gathered an army against the shogunate at Shinomura Hachimangu in Tamba Province to capture Rokuhara Tandai.\\nHis achievements were evaluated by Emperor Go-Daigo, and he was awarded the letter (尊), which came from the emperor\\'s real name Takaharu (尊治), so he changed the letter in his name from \"高氏\" to \"尊氏\".\\nWhile the despotic Kenmu restoration by Emperor Go-Daigo had been losing support, Takauji traveled to the east to suppress the Nakasendai Rebellion, and stayed in Kamakura to try to build his own government.\\nBecause of this, the relationship between Takauji and the imperial court came to an impasse, and he returned to Kyoto, driving the Emperor Go-Daigo out to Mt. Hiei. However, the Emperor\\'s army made a counterattack and Takauji fled to Kyushu temporarily.\\nHe reentered Kyoto and established a new samurai government called the Muromachi Shogunate, being appointed Seii Taishogun by Grand Emperor (Retired Emperor) Kogon and Emperor Komyo.\\nAt the same time, Emperor Go-Daigo moved to Yoshino and set up the Southern Court there.\\nAfter he established the Muromachi Shogunate, he and his brother Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA divided power between them, but in later years discord between them increased until the Kanno Disturbance.\\nThe disturbance subsided with the death of Tadayoshi, but even after that Takauji had to keep fighting against his enemies, such as the Southern Court forces, to maintain his government.\\nAfter Emperor Go-Daigo died, Takauji built Tenryu-ji Temple to pray for the dead.\\nBecause of his rebellion against the emperor, people had branded him as a traitor since the Meiji era, but after World War II they began to look at him more positively, which illustrates how much the historical point of view affects the way we look at the people in history.\\nFrom Birth to the Fall of the Kamakura Shogunate\\nTakauji was born in 1305.\\nThere are 3 presumptions about his birthplace: Ayabe (Uesugisho in Ayabe City, Kyoto), Kamakura and Ashikagano sho (Ashikaga City, Tochigi Prefecture).\\n\"Nan-Taiheiki\" says that when Takauji was given his first bath, two turtledoves flew in; one perched on his shoulder, and the other on the dipper.\\nHis childhood name was Matataro.\\nOn October 10th, 1319, his coming-of-age ceremony (Genpuku) was held at age 15, and he was appointed Jibutaifu of the Fifth Rank, Junior Grade, and given the name Takauji by the regent Takatoki HOJO.\\nTakauji\\'s father Sadauji and his official wife Shakado, daughter of Akitoki HOJO, had the first son Takayoshi ASHIKAGA, but he died early and Takauji succeeded to his father.\\nAccording to \"Nan-Taiheiki\", Ietoki ASHIKAGA, Takauji\\'s grandfather, killed himself with his sword, praying that the Ashikaga clan may rule over the whole country in 3 generations.\\nIn 1331, Emperor Go-Daigo plotted the overthrow of the shogunate again and raised an army at Kasagi (Genko Incident).\\nThe Kamakura shogunate ordered Takauji, who had been a powerful vassal, to help the shogunate, and he joined the battles at Kasagi where the emperor was based and at Shimoakasaka Castle in which Masashige KUSUNOKI was based.\\nThe incident had taken place just after his father\\'s death, so Takauji at first had refused his help to the shogunate, but the Kamakura shogunate took his wife and children as hostages to make Takauji follow its order.\\nAccording to \"Koten-Taiheiki,\" because of this Takauji began to harbor hostility toward the shogunate.\\nAs a result of the attack against the emperor made by the shogunate, the emperor and his followers such as Toshimoto HINO and Enkan were captured, and the following year Emperor Go-Daigo was exiled to Oki Islands (Genko Rebellion).\\nThe shogunate installed Emperor Kogon of the Jimyo-in line as emperor, instead of Emperor Go-Daigo of the Daikaku-ji line.\\nIn the following year, Emperor Go-Daigo escaped from Oki Islands, and raised an army at Mt. Senjosan.\\nTakauji was ordered to reenter Kyoto with Takaie NAGOE to put down the rebellion in the west.\\nTakaie was killed by Norimura AKAMATSU, which made Takauji decide to side with the emperor. On April 29th of the same year, he raised an army against the shogunate at Shinomura Hachimangu (present Kameoka City, Kyoto) in Tamba Province.\\nTakauji gathered forces from various provinces, and entered Kyoto followed by vassals such as Doyo SASAKI from Omi Province, and then succeeded in destroying Rokuhara Tandai on May 7th, 1333.\\nAt about the same time, Yoshisada NITTA, vassal of Kozuke Province, also gathered an army, and destroyed the shogunate, taking Takauji\\'s heir Senjuo (later called Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA), who had escaped from Kamakura, with him.\\nIn this fighting, Takewakamaru, the son of Takauji\\'s concubine, was killed.\\nAfter the Kamakura shogunate was crumbled, Takauji ordered Kazuuji HOSOKAWA, Yoriharu HOSOKAWA and Morouji HOSOKAWA to make Yoshisada NITTA return to Kyoto, and let the Ashikaga clan rule Kamakura.\\nAfter the fall of the Kamakura shogunate, Emperor Go-Daigo considered Takauji\\'s work to be commendable, and gave him the ranks of Chinjufu Shogun and Sahyoe no Kami with the courtly title of Fourth Rank, Junior Grade, along with 30 plots of land.\\nIn addition to that, he was given the letter (尊), which came from the emperor\\'s given name, and changed the letter of his name Takauji (高氏) into Takauji (尊氏).\\nUnder the Kenmu administration, Takauji left politics and let KO no Moronao, the regent of the Ashikaga clan, and KO no Moroyasu engage in politics, while he made his brother Tadayoshi the regent of the Kamakura Shogunfu.\\nThere are two interpretations of Takauji\\'s behavior; one is that it was Emperor Go-Daigo who made Takauji leave politics, and the other is that it was Takauji who tried to keep away from the government.\\nThere is also a different presumption that Takauji intended to establish the new government in Kamakura.\\nThis condition was called \"Takauji\\'s absence in the new government\".\\nWhile Emperor Go-Daigo appointed Akiie KITABATAKE as Chinjufu Shogun and made him take Prince Noriyoshi (later called Emperor GO-Murakami) to Oshu in order to pacify the place, Takauji made Tadayoshi lead young Prince Narinaga (Nariyoshi) down to Kamakura.\\nEmperor Go-Daigo\\'s son Prince Morinaga, who also coveted the title of Seii Taishogun, gradually came to rival Takauji, and plotted to assassinate him, but Takauji\\'s security was so tight that he failed to do it.\\nIn 1334, Takauji captured and confined Prince Morinaga, who was in conflict with the emperor too, to Tadayoshi\\'s place in Kamakura, conspiring with the emperor\\'s mistress Yasuko (Kadoko) ANO, who wanted to make her son Prince Tsunenaga (Tsuneyoshi) a crown prince.\\nIn 1335, Nakasendai Rebellion was raised in Shinano Province by the survivors of the HOJO clan, taking Tokiyuki HOJO, bereaved son of Takatoki HOJO, with them, and Tokiyuki\\'s army occupied Kamakura temporarily.\\nIn the rebellion, Tadayoshi killed Prince Morinaga without permission.\\nTakauji requested that Emperor Go-Daigo appoint him Seii Taishogun only to be rejected, so he marched to Kamakura without emperor\\'s permission on August 2nd of the same year, which made Emperor Go-Daigo reluctantly appoint him as Seito Taishogun.\\nTadayoshi\\'s army, joined by Takauji, defeated Tokiyuki HOJO at the Battle of Sagamigawa and regained Kamakura on the 19th of the same month.\\nTakauji was given the courtly title of the Second Rank.\\nWith Tadayoshi\\'s approval, Takauji established a base in Kamakura and began to allot lands to his followers, ignoring the emperor\\'s command to return to Kyoto, and he tried to establish his own samurai government.\\nIn November, Takauji suggested to the emperor that Yoshisada NITTA was an enemy of the imperial court and should be killed, but on the contrary the emperor ordered Yoshisada to kill Takauji, making Yoshisada take Prince Takanaga (Takayoshi) to Kamakura along Tokaido.\\nBesides that, Akiie KITABATAKE began to go down to Kyoto from Oshu, so Takauji declared his retirement to get a reprieve. However, once the Ashikaga side, including Tadayoshi and KO no Moronao, began to lose at various provinces such as Mikawa, Takauji decided to revolt against the Kenmu government.\\nIn December of the same year, Takauji defeated Nitta\\'s army at the Battle of Hakone Take no Shita, and advanced his army up to Kyoto.\\nDuring that time, Takauji secretly made contact with Emperor Kogon of the Jimyo-in line to justify his entering Kyoto.\\nIn the following month, Takauji reached Kyoto, while Emperor GO-Daigo fled to Mt. Hiei.\\nShortly thereafter, Takauji was attacked in Kyoto by the armies of Akiie KITABATAKE, Masashige KUSUNOKI and Yoshisada NITTA from Oshu, and he gave up Kyoto, accepting Enshin AKAMATSU\\'s advice to leave for Kyushu.\\nOn his way down to Kyushu, Yoshinao (Yorihisa) SHONI came to meet him at Akamagaseki, Nagato Province (present Shimonoseki City, Yamaguchi Prefecture), and he was supported by Ujinori MUNAKATA, the chief priest of Munakata Taisha Shrine in Munakata, Chikuzen Province.\\nIn the beginning of March, after visiting Munakata Taisha, Takauji defeated Taketoshi KIKUCHI (Emperor Go-Daigo\\'s side) at the Battle of Tatarahama (present Fukuoka City), and on his way up to Kyoto, he got Emperor Kogon\\'s order and immediately gathered western warriors.\\nHe smashed the armies of Yoshisada NITTA and Masashige KUSUNOKI at the Battle of Minatogawa on April 25th of the same year, and seized Kyoto again in June.\\nTakauji attempted a reconciliation with Emperor Go-Daigo, who had been at Mt. Hiei, to save face for the emperor.\\nEmperor Go-Daigo, accepting Takauji\\'s offer, transferred the Imperial Regalia of Japan to Emperor Komyo, a younger brother of Grand Emperor Kogon, and right after that, on November 7th, Takauji declared the opening of a new samurai government, setting the Kenmu Shikimoku in order to show the basic policy of his government to his people.\\nEmperor Go-Daigo escaped from Kyoto to Yoshino (present Yoshino-cho, Yoshino-gun, Nara Prefecture) taking the Imperial Regalia of Japan with him in December, and announced that the transferred regalia were fake, so he established Yoshino Imperial Court (=Southern Court).\\nIn 1338, Takauji was appointed Seii Taishogun (reigned 1338-58) by Emperor Komyo, which meant that an actual samurai government later called Muromachi Shogunate was established.\\nIn the following year, when Emperor Go-Daigo passed away in Yoshino, Takauji began to found Tenryu-ji temple to pray for the soul of the dead emperor.\\nIn order to raise the funds to build the temple, a trading vessel called Tenryu-ji-bune was set sail for Yuan Dynasty.\\nUnder the new government, Takauji gave Tadayoshi a post as administrative leader and he himself became the leader of the house vassals.\\nShin\\'ichi Sato called such conditions diarchy by Takauji, who held a military power in the lord-and-vassal relationship, and Tadayoshi, who controlled the judicial functions of the regime, in his essay \\'Muromachi Bakufu\\' in \"Iawanami Koza Nihon Rekishi vol.7\" (Iawanami Publishing, 1963) and explained that the potentiality of the shogun\\'s dual power which had continued since Kamakura Shogunate, came to appear.\\nThe dual power gradually led to a conflict between anti-Tadayoshi group represented by KO no Moronao, and the Tadayoshi group in the government.\\nThis conflict finally raised an internal split called the Kanno Disturbance.\\nAt first Takauji took a neutral stance on it, but he came to side with Moronao\\'s group.\\nIn 1349, Moronao demanded Tadayoshi\\'s retirement from politics, surrounding Takauji\\'s castle in which Tadayoshi had sheltered.\\nTadayoshi became a priest and lost his power, but it is said that Moronao and Takauji made an arrangement to exclude Tadayoshi.\\nWhile Takauji called back his heir Yoshiakira from Kamakura to put him in charge of political affairs instead of Tadayoshi, he sent his second son Motouji ASHIKAGA to Kamakura in return and set the Kamakurafu to rule the eastern provinces, appointing Motouji Kamakura kubo.\\nAfter Tadayoshi\\'s retreat, Takauji\\'s illegitimate son - also Tadayoshi\\'s adopted son - Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA was enlarging his power as a member of the Tadayoshi faction in Kyushu, so Takauji made an expedition to Chugoku District to kill Tadafuyu in 1350.\\nThen Tadayoshi escaped from Kyoto and sided with the Southern Court, followed by a few of the devoted military commanders such as Tadatsune MOMONOI and Kunikiyo HATAKEYAMA.\\nWhen Tadayoshi\\'s army grew stronger, Yoshiakira became powerless and fled from Kyoto. Takauji was also defeated by Tadayoshi\\'s army at Uchidehama in Settsu Province (present Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture).\\nTakauji sought reconciliation with Tadayoshi on condition that the KO brothers would become priests, and they came to an agreement in 1351.\\nThe KO brothers were assassinated by Yoshinori UESUGI while they were under escort.\\nTadayoshi became Yoshiakira\\'s assistant and got involved in political affairs again.\\nTakauji and Yoshiakira marched to Harima Province on the ostensible purpose to put down the revolt plotted by Doyo SASAKI and Sokuyu (Norisuke) AKAMATSU, but in reality they attempted a reconciliation with the Southern Court, conspiring to kill Tadayoshi and Tadafuyu.\\nSensing this conspiracy, Tadayoshi fled to the northern area and reached Kamakura.\\nIn October of the same year, Takauji and the Southern Court reconciled, an event that was called Shohei-itto.\\nAt the same time, Takauji chased Tadayoshi along the Tokaido, and defeated him at the battles of Mt. Satsutamayama in Suruga Province (present-day Shimizu Ward, Shimizu City, Shizuoka Prefecture) and Hayakawajiri in Sagami Province (present-day Odawara City, Kanagawa Prefecture). Takauji captured Tadayoshi and confined him in Kamakura.\\nTadayoshi died suddenly in February, 1352.\\n\"Taiheiki\" says that Tadayoshi might have been poisoned by Takauji.\\nSoon after Tadayoshi\\'s death, being attacked by the Southern Court forces represented by Prince Muneyoshi, Yoshioki NITTA, Yoshimune NITTA and Tokiyuki HOJO, Takauji retreated to Musashi Province, but soon returned to Kyoto to defeat the Southern forces.\\nAfter that Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA intruded in Kyoto, but eventually he left for Kyushu.\\nIn 1354, Kyoto was retaken by the Southern Court temporarily, but taken back by Takauji the following year.\\nHe plotted to kill Tadafuyu, but died of a tumor on his back at the palace of Made\\'nokoji in Nijo, Kyoto, on April 30th, 1358.\\nHis age at death: 54.\\nAccording to \"Baishoron,\" Takauji regretted having turned against Emperor Go-Daigo, and he for a while he was talking about becoming a priest. In the heat of battle he also talked about killing himself, so Shin\\'ichi SATO took these descriptions into consideration, and presumed that Takauji might have been a manic depressive.\\nTakauji\\'s close friend Soseki MUSO described Takauji as a man of virtue in his writing.\\nTakauji was willing to allot lands to his military commanders, which is considered one of the reasons why he was always supported by them when he was in difficult situations.\\nIt was the Mitogaku originated by Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA that started to consider Takauji as a traitor in the Edo period.\\nMitogaku was strongly influenced by Shushigaku Meibunron, and emphasized the validity of the Imperial line.\\nBecause of this, Takauji, who exiled the authentic emperor (Go-Daigo), was described in a negative way as a traitor.\\nMitogaku\\'s view of Takauji was inherited by the later generations, and in the late Tokugawa period when Sonno-Joi (Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarian) culminated, the heads of wooden statues of Takauji, Yoshiakira and Yoshimitsu (ASHIKAGA) in Toji-in were pilloried.\\nAfter the Meiji period, the Meiji government sought to establish a nation-state which set the emperor in the center of the nation. This produced a nationalistic view of history, which justified Taisei Hokan and Osei Fukko, and so the Taika Reforms, Kenmu no Chuko (=Kenmu restoration) and Meiji Restoration were ranked as the most important reforms.\\nUntil mid Meiji period, source-based study of modern history did not emphasize the validity of Emperor Go-Daigo (the Southern Court), but at around 1907 40 when the Nanbokucho Seijunron arose, the validity of Emperor Go-Daigo came to be stressed, creating a negative evaluation of Takauji.\\nAccording to an authorized textbook written before WWII, Takauji was \"a traitor who released an arrow against the Emperor\", and Kumakichi NAKAJIMA, a member of the Makoto SAITO Cabinet, was forced to retire because he had praised Takauji in his writing.\\nAfter WWII, the nationalistic view of history became obsolete, and the source-based study of history made progress on reevaluating Takauji.\\nSato\\'s interpretation of Takauji as a ruler in the lord-and-vassal relationship was one example, which afforded an opportunity to develop a study of the samurai government.\\nIn today\\'s historical study, nobody interprets Takauji as a traitor any more, and the process of Takauji\\'s becoming a traitor sometimes can be a theme of historical study.\\n\"Shihon Taiheiki\" written by Eiji YOSHIKAWA in the late 1950s had Takauji as a main character, and was accepted by many readers, which suggested that not only the political but also the cultural view of Takauji had shifted very much compared with that before WWII.\\n\"Kibamusha zo\" (a portrait of warrior on the horse back), preserved in the Kyoto National Museum, was generally known as a portrait of Takauji, but is now considered to be a portrait of KO no Moronao, the regent of the Ashikaga clan, or that of KO no Moroakira, son of Moronao. It\\'s because there\\'s a decorative signature of the 2nd shogun Yoshiakira on the upper part of the body, and the family crest of the two rings described on the warrior\\'s harness was not the Ashikaga family\\'s, but the KO family\\'s.\\nPortrait of Taira no Shigemori, one of the Jingo-ji san zo, painted by FUJIWARA no Takanobu in Kamakura period, had been considered a portrait of Shigemori TAIRA, but Michio YONEKURA and Hideo KURODA claimed that it is a portrait of Takauji, and now this interpretation is widely accepted.\\nTheir opinion is based on the comparison of the portrait with the wooden statue of Takauji preserved in Toji-in, and the popular shape of the hatpin, called Kogai, used in the early Muromachi period.\\nThere\\'s another portrait of Takauji preserved in Jodo-ji Temple in Onomichi City, Hiroshima Prefecture.\\nIn addition to that, there are some ukiyoe pictures of Takauji: \"Taiheiki Kassenzu,\" by Yoshitora UTAGAWA; and \"Ashikaga Takauji Hyogo Kassenzu,\" by Chikanobu HASHIMOTO. Both paintings deal with Takauji sheltering in the Jodo-ji Temple in Hyogo Prefecture.\\nAlso some bronze statues of Takauji were made recently; one is placed on the approach to the Bunna-ji Temple in Ashikaga City, and the other is in Ankokuji Town, Ayabe City, Kyoto Prefecture.\\nFather: Sadauji ASHIKAGA\\nMother: Kiyoko UESUGI\\nYounger Brother: Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA\\nTakauji ASHIKAGA\\nWife: Toko AKAHASHI\\nChild: Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA\\nChild: a daughter\\nChild: Seio\\nChild: Motouji ASHIKAGA\\nChild: Yoriko (Raishi), empress of Emperor Suko\\nChild: Ryosei\\nChild: a daughter\\nConcubine: a daughter of Motouji KAKO (Buddhist name: Unkoin Kakuhen, a member of the Ashikaga clan) (according to \"Sonpi Bunmyaku\" and \"Keizu San\\'yo\")\\nChild: Takewakamaru ASHIKAGA\\nConcubine: (Echizen no tsubone?)\\nChild: Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA\\nConcubine\\nChild: Eichu Hoshun\\nTaiheiki\\nBaishoron\\nTaiheiki written by Seiichi MORIMURA\\nShihon Taiheiki written by Eiji YOSHIKAWA\\nShin Taiheiki written by Sohachi YAMAOKA\\nAshikaga Takauji written by Fuyuji DOMON\\nAshikaga Takauji written by Genzo MURAKAMI\\nKaze no Gunzo written by Sonoko SUGIMOTO\\nTaiheiki (NHK Taiga drama) (Cast: Toshiyuki AMAGASA/ Hiroyuki SANADA, 1991)\\nHojo Tokimune (NHK Taiga drama) (Cast: Yosuke MITSUHASHI, 2001)\\nSagano Scenic Railway is the company operating Torokko trams on the Sagano Sight-seeing Tram Line, which utilizes the old San-in Line in Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.\\nSagano Scenic Railway is a wholly-owned subsidiary of West Japan Railway Company.\\nThe head office is located in Sagatenryuji Kurumamichi-cho, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.\\nTo electrify the railway and install multiple tracks, the San-in Line (Sagano Line) between Saga (now Saga-Arashiyama) and Umahori was replaced with a new line in March, 1989, after which the old line along Hozukyo, a famous scenic site, was made into a sight-seeing railway, thereby starting Torokko tram service in 1991.\\nAccording to Keitetsu Kyokai\\'s \"Unknown Railways\" (JTB, 1997), Sagano Scenic Railway is the first railway used purely for sightseeing in Japan.\\nIn front of Saga Torokko Station, which is the start of the Torokko tram on the Kyoto side, there is the 19th CENTURY HALL in which science, technology, and art of the 19th century are on display, and which is also managed by Sagano Scenic Railway.\\n19th CENTURY HALL displays steam locomotives such as Japanese National Railways Steam Locomotive D51.\\nHistory\\nIn November 4, 1990, Sagano Scenic Railway was founded.\\nOn April 27, 1991, Sagano Sight-seeing Tram Line between Saga Torokko Station and Kameoka Torokko Station opened.\\nBeginning in November, 2002, \"Torokky\" was used as a poster boy.\\nIn April, 2003, 19th CENTURY HALL opened in front of Saga Torokko Station.\\nRoute\\nSee below for operations.\\nSagano Scenic Railway, Sagano Sight-seeing Tram Line - Saga Torokko Station to Kameoka Torokko Station: 7.3km\\nVehicles\\nThe rail cars all belonged to JR (Japan Railway Company) and have been remodeled for use.\\nFor locomotives, Japanese National Railways Diesel Locomotives DE10-1104 and DE10-1156 were repainted, the former mainly in current use, and the latter belonging to JR as a reserve.\\nFor passenger cars, Japanese National Railways freight cars, Toki 25000, were remodeled.\\nThe Kyoto City Transportation Bureau is a local public enterprise engaged in the provision of public transportation services in Kyoto City and its vicinity.\\nIt operates subway lines (Kyoto Municipal Subways/Kyoto City Subway) and local bus routes (Kyoto City Bus).\\nIt was once the operator of the Kyoto Municipal Streetcar (京都市電) and the Kyoto City Trolleybus.\\nWhen using the KANSAI THRU PASS, \"Kyoko\" (京交) is printed on the card when you enter a station or get on a bus, while \"KC\" is printed on it when you exit a station or get off a bus.\\nServices\\nKyoto City Subway (two lines, 31.2 km)\\nKyoto City Bus\\nHistory\\nRefer to \"Kyoto City Subway,\" \"Kyoto City Bus,\" \"Kyoto Municipal Street Car\" and \"Kyoto City Trolleybus\" for a detailed history of each service.\\nFebruary 1, 1895: The inauguration of Japan\\'s first streetcar service by Kyoto Electric Railway (京都電気鉄道) between Shiokoji-Higashinotoin Kudaru (the present-day areas in front of Kyoto Station) and Shimo-aburakake-cho Fushimi was held.\\nJune 11, 1912: The inauguration of streetcar service by Kyoto City Electric Tramway (京都市電気軌道事務所);

              "'Rinzai Zen Buddhism is one of the Chinese five Houses / seven Schools of Zen ( Rinzai , Igyou , Soto , Unmon , Hogan ) and Gigen RINZAI ( ? - 867 ) of Tang was its founder .\\nHe was known as \" RINZAI of Katu ( meaning to help wake up the sleeping mind ) \" and \" General RINZAI \" , and rose to the top of Chinese Zen with his distinctive style .\\nWith its Zen Talks that try to awaken self awareness through study of Koan , it differs from the Silent Zen of the Soto sect , which just does meditation .\\nRinzai School in China\\nAs the name implies , Rinzai School started with its founder Gigen RINZAI at the end of the Tang dynasty , after the anti-Buddhist movement at the Kaishou era .\\nRINZAI was the disciple of Kiun OBAKU ; the school grew as a religious movement centered in the province of Hebei , with the support of Changshi WANG of the Hanchin government , but in the confusion that arose around the end of the Tang dynasty , Hebei was at the center of the tumultuous five dynasties and it became difficult to sustain a religious movement .\\nThe central figure around that time was Enshou FUKETSU .\\nIt was in the Northern Song dynasty that Rinzai School became vibrant again , below the gates of Sekiso SOEN , along with Enan OURYU and Houe YOUGI who came from Jiangxi province and created the two main sectes of Rinzai ( Ouryu and Yougi ) , and swept across all of China .\\nWhen it came to the Southern Song dynasty , Soukou DAIE , a disciple of Kokugon ENGO who belonged to the Yougi sect , started the Daikan sect in Zhejiang province , which became a major sect in the Rinzai School .\\nRinzai School in Japan\\nAccording to doctrine , it was brought over to China from India by Bodhidharma , the 28th successor of the 10 disciples ( called Kasho ) who directly received the teaching ( enlightenment ) of Siddhartha Gautama .\\nLater the Rinzai school , which achieved the pinnacle of Zen teaching , was brought to Japan in the Kamakura period by Eisai , who went to China to study in the Southern Song period .\\nJapan \\'s Rinzai is one of Zen schools in Japan .\\nIt emphasizes the transmission of enlightenment from teacher to disciple . ( Hassu is the disciple who inherited the teaching of the master . )\\nIt calls Sakyamuni the Original Teacher Venerable Sakyamuni Buddha , Bodhidharma the First Ancestor and Great Teacher Bodhidharma , and RINZAI the Founder and Great Teacher Rinzai .\\nIn contrast to the Soto Zen school which spreads through regional clans and the general people , the Rinzai School received support from Samurai families in government , and was esteemed in the politics and culture .\\nLater , the Rinzai School was rebuilt in the Edo period by Master HAKUIN , and continued to be called Hakuin Zen .\\nTraditions\\nTransmission of enlightenment from masters to disciples continues down to the present day ( Hassu is the disciple who inherited the teaching of the master ) .\\nThe important interaction between the master and disciple is called \" a secret in the room \" and is not to be taken out of the master \\'s room and revealed publicly .\\nWhat is extracted from the interactions between a master and disciple , or Zen lecture transcripts that record the actions of a master , is called a Koan ( precedent ) and various collections have been compiled since the Song dynasty ; but enlightenment is not something that can be communicated with words , so when people today try to understand the text , the Koan itself refuses them .\\nHowever , they contain hints that lead people toward enlightenment , and there are a great many Zen books from the beginning down to the present day .\\nAlso since the Song dynasty , the Zen schools changed to a Kannazen style in which masters give lectures using transcripts of Zen talks and the masters became not to display the same majesty as those in the Tang dynasty including Rinzai .\\nAlthough masters choose their successors when they die , the successors have not necessarily attained enlightenment by that time , but that fact is only known to the master and the successor himself .\\nEven if the new master had not attained enlightenment , the disciples would have been able to do so if it is within a few generations from that of the master who gained enlightenment , therefore it is possible to take such a measure .\\nIt is possible for a master to leave behind several new masters , or at his discretion not to leave a successor and bring his line to an end .\\nMany lines have split , and some have disappeared ; in this way some of those lines have come down from the 7th century to the present day .\\nEnlightenment\\nThe Zen sects generally emphasize enlightenment over knowledge .\\nEnlightenment in Zen means that all living things realize the inherent buddha nature they possess .\\nFor this reason , masters in the Tang dynasty struggled to enlightenment through much hardship .\\nHowever , they began to devise many techniques for gaining enlightenment from the Song dynasty .\\nThese were systematized so that enlightenment could be gained by performing training such as Zazen ( not the same as meditation ) , Koan ( understanding stories that surpass intellectual understanding ) , Dokyou ( reading sutras ) , or Samu ( everyday work ) under an already enlightened Zen master .\\nEnlightenment is thought to pass from the master to the disciple as a candle flame passes to a candle that is unlit ( called Dentou ) .\\nThat is not a transmission based on words ( logos ) .\\nFor this reason , it is considered crucial to choose the right Zen master .\\nThat means not just choosing one who has gained enlightenment , but one who fits with one \\'s own personality .\\nActually , it does not mean that an enlightened Zen master instructs and enables someone gain enlightenment .\\nMasters in the Tang dynasty did not learn to get enlightenment from anybody - not to mention Siddhartha Gautama ( Buddha , Shakuson ) , who gained enlightenment without a teacher .\\nWhile it is impossible to define enlightenment with words , words are one of many methods that can describe the boundaries of enlightenment .\\nThat is why , especially after it was brought to Japan , enlightenment has been expressed through artistic expression such as poetry and painting , so that one can get a taste of its aroma .\\nOther than in art , it is also expressed in deportments such as tea ceremony and flower arrangement ; and methods to get a taste of the world of enlightenment have also been born .\\nThat is not an intellectual understanding .\\nThe Koan System\\nThe Koan system came together after the Song dynasty , and though they might be fabricated it has made even more enlightenments possible .\\nMost Koan are made up of conversations between a master and disciple , telling the truth of the moment when the disciple gained enlightenment .\\nKoan cannot be received with logical , intellectual understanding , and are stories beyond logic that can be understood only by completely becoming the Koan itself instead of thinking .\\nThe Koan system was established by collecting these Koan stories as a method for leading disciples and was composed of 500 to 1900 Koan stories .\\nKoan system differs according to the master \\'s style .\\nExamples of Koan stories in the beginning .\\n\" Does a dog have buddha-nature ? \" \" It does not have . \"\\nAs the background , any Buddhist knows that \" all living things have Buddha-nature . \"\\nThe Sound of One Hand Clapping\\nA disciple has to listen to the sound of clapping with one hand and show that to the master .\\nBy intellectual understanding , it is impossible to clap with one hand and make a sound .\\nSects\\nKenni-ji sect\\nThe sect began when Eisai came back from Southern Song China in 1202 .\\nEisai was the first to bring the Zen tradition to Japan .\\nHead temple is Kenni-ji in Kyoto

City .\\n\" Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle \" is a recent construction that did not exist historically ( details to follow ) .\\nFushimi-jo Castle was originally built by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI for his own residence after retirement .\\nConstruction spanning the reigns of 3 emperors , it was first built on Mt . Shizuki , there called Shizuki Fushimi-jo Castle , and after an earthquake was moved to Mt . Kohata and named Kohata Fushimi-jo Castle .\\nFurthermore , there was the Kohata Fushimi-jo Castle that was built in the days of Toyotomi , and the one that was rebuilt in the Tokugawa days after being destroyed in the battle of Sekigahara .\\nAfter Hideyoshi \\'s death and in accordance with his will , Hideyori TOYOTOMI moved to Osaka-jo Castle ; after which Ieyasu TOKUGAWA , leader of the council of 5 elders , moved into this castle and took over government .\\nAlthough it was protected by Ieyasu \\'s vassals , Mototada TORII et alia , during the Battle of Sekigahara , it was attacked and burned by Ishida ( the Siege of Fushimi-jo Castle ) .\\nIt was later rebuilt by Ieyasu ; and after it was razed its structures and materials were moved to other locations .\\nAfter it was razed , the location of the citadel was made into a peach orchard and was called Momoyama ( Peach Mountain ) .\\nThat is why Fushimi-jo Castle is typically called Momoyama-jo Castle ; and this is the reason why the period of Oda-Toyotomi government is called the \" Azuchi-Momoyama Period \" and the culture of the time called \" Momoyama Culture \" .\\nAccording to the account that says the descendants of the family that reclaimed the land are the Yoshimura family , which founded Yoshimura Shuzo , they were the heads of Horiuchi Village , built on the ruins of Fushimi-jo Castle ; and it is said that they transferred village land to the Imperial Household in the Meiji Period .\\nHistorically , there was no direct connection .\\nSince the Tokugawa-era keep was moved to Nijo-jo Castle , there is a relatively large number of artifacts left ; but there is much that is unclear about the previous keep .\\nThe details are unclear .\\n1592 - In the low-lying hills along the Uji-gawa River where Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI made his home on Mt . Shizuki in retirement , parts of the dismantled Jurakudai were transferred for the building of a castle ( Shizuki-jo Castle ) .\\n1596 - Because it was destroyed in an earthquake , a new castle was built about 500 meters away on Mt . Kohata ( present day Mt . Momoyama ) .\\n1598 - Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI died in this castle\\n1600 - Burned in the Siege of Fushimi Castle\\n1601 - Rebuilt by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA\\n1603 - Was the site of the inauguration of Seii Taishogun\\nFushimi-jo Castle \\'s functions moved to Osaka-jo Castle after the Siege of Osaka , reducing this castle \\'s importance in the eyes of the Edo Shogunate ; and it was therefore razed in 1625 after Ieyasu TOKUGAWA \\'s retirement .\\n1964 - Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle Land , an amusement park featuring a mock castle keep \" Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle \" , was built on the site of the Fushimi-jo Castle flower garden .\\nJanuary 2003 - Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle Land was closed as part of the restructuring of its parent company , Kintetsu Corporation .\\nFushimi Momoyama-jo Castle escaped destruction thanks to a movement by the people of Kyoto to preserve it as a symbol of Fushimi .\\nNowadays it is maintained as a park .\\nThe City of Kyoto received it at no cost ; but the inside is closed to the public because it has deteriorated with age .\\nOctober 2007 - When it was remodeled to look like Osaka-jo Castle for the filming of a period movie , \" Chacha : The Woman from Far Away \" , the tiger decorations below the watch tower and Shachihoko were painted gold .\\nWith Toei Films bearing the remodeling cost of around 1 million yen , work to remake it into Osaka-jo Castle continues within the year .\\nWhen the castle was dismantled , the keep and many other buildings were moved to other locations .\\nThe most famous are Nijo-jo Castle and Jojakko-ji Temple ; the turrets , castle gate , palace , bath , Tamon Yagura Turret , and earthen walls all were moved to Fukuyama-jo Castle ( Bingo Province ) .\\nBelow is a list of major items that are thought to have been moved and still exist .\\nNote : Among these , the only ones that can be proven are the guest hall of Saikyo-ji Temple , which is the remains from Mt .

Watanabe Shuko-ji Temple ( Toyota City , Aichi Prefecture ) : Main Hall\\nFushimi Goten Fusuma Painting - Fukuyama-jo Castle ( Fukuyama City , Hiroshima Prefecture )\\nThe Kanoha group is the largest gaha ( group of painters ) in Japanese art history , and was active for about 400 years from the middle of the Muromachi period ( fifteenth century ) to the end of the Edo period ( nineteenth century ) as a group of expert painters that consistently dominated the art world .\\nMasanobu KANO , the official painter of the Muromachi shogunate , was the earliest ancestor ; his descendants worked for Nobunaga ODA , Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and the Tokugawa Shogun as painters after the collapse of the Muromachi shogunate , consistently dominating the art world associated with the powers-that-be , thus greatly influencing Japanese art circles as a professional painter group working on works ranging from screen paintings in the Imperial Palace , castles or large temples to small paintings such as those created on fans .\\nThe Kanoha group is a painter group mainly concerned with consanguinity such as parents or brothers ; it reigned over the nation \\'s realm of art for as long as four centuries , a period unequaled anywhere in the world .\\nProminent painters of the Kanoha group include the founder Masanobu KANO , who worked for Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA , the eighth Seii taishogun ( literally , \" great general who subdues the barbarians \" ) of the Muromachi shogunate ; his heir , Motonobu KANO , a grandson of Motonobu ; Eitoku KANO , who created screen paintings of the Azuchi and Osaka castles ; a grandson of Eitoku , Tanyu KANO , who moved from Kyoto to Edo and supervised the creation of screen paintings of Edo Castle and Nijo Castle ; Sanraku KANO , who stayed in Kyoto , thus representing a group called \\' Kyo Kano . \\'\\nOnce the structure of the Edo shogunate had become stable , the members of the Kanoha group were driven to get extensive orders done for screen paintings of the Imperial Palace and castles as the shogunate \\'s official painters .\\nIn order to fulfill large numbers of orders for screen paintings , the head of the Kano family needed to lead the painters so they could work in a group .\\nConsequently , the painters of the Kanoha group needed to learn ancestral painting examples and ways of painting without expressing their individuality as painters .\\nGiven such an historical backdrop , it can be said that the Kanoha group after Tanyu KANO only tried to keep the tradition and maintain influence as official painters , and therefore lost its artistic drive .\\nIn the present day , an artist \\'s expression of individuality and mentality is valued , so the evaluation of paintings of the Kanoha group is not necessarily high .\\nHowever , it is a fact that the Kanoha group led the Japanese art world for about four centuries and that numbers of painters were developed by the group ; thus one can hardly discuss the history of Japanese painting but exclude the Kanoha group , whether in positive or negative terms .\\nIt is also a fact that many Japanese painters after the early years of the modern age were influenced by the Kanoha group and started with the influence of the Kanoha group ; initially , Korin OGATA , of the Rinpa group , and Okyo MARUYAMA of the Shaseiha group had learned from the Kanoha group .\\nThe Kanoha group was founded by Masanobu KANO ( c . 1434 - 1530 ) , who worked as the official painter for the Muromachi shogunate .\\nHe lived quite long for a Japanese of the time ( it is commonly believed that he died at age 97 ) , and worked from the middle of the fifteenth century until the early sixteenth century .\\nIt is said that he was from the Izu area , but that is uncertain .\\nDue to the progress of study after the late twentieth century , it is speculated that the Kano family was somehow related to the Nagao clan in Ashikaga , Shimotsuke Province ( Ashikaga City , Tochigi Prefecture ) ; and \" Waterfall , \" an ink painting that remains at Chorin-ji Temple in Ashikaga City , is considered a relatively early work by Masanobu .\\nThe first painting work recorded as having been done by Masanobu is the screen paintings he did of the Deity of Mercy and Luohan in Unchoin , Shokoku-ji Temple Tower , which he did in Kyoto at the age of 30 in 1463 . This was just before the turmoil of the Onin War ( 1467 - 1477 ) ( as reported in Inryoken Nichiroku ( Inryoken \\'s Diary ) ) , which tells us that Masanobu was already working as a painter in Kyoto by that time .\\nShokoku-ji Temple , as the main temple building of Unchoin , where Masanobu created the screen paintings , is a Zendera temple constructed by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA , the third Shogun of the Muromachi shogunate ; it is the heart of the Muromachi art world , which produced artist-monks such as Josetsu , Shubun , Sesshu ; moreover , in those days Sotan ( Sotan OGURI , 1413 - 1481 ) , an artist-monk who was a disciple of Shubun , worked as an official painter .\\nAlthough it is not exactly certain when Masanobu KANO went to Kyoto , whom he studied under and when he became the official painter for the Muromachi shogunate , it is clear ( according to certain records ) that Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA , the eighth Shogun of the Muromachi shogunate , gave him an important position .\\nIn 1481 , a few years after the tumultuous Onin War ( 1467 - 1477 ) , which had lasted for a decade , Sotan , the official painter for the Muromachi shogunate , died ; thus it is thought that Masanobu KANO was appointed as the official painter for the shogunate , succeeding Sotan .\\nSubsequently , Mitsunobu TOSA , of the Yamatoe group ( a style of Japanese painting ) who was in the postion of Edokoro-azukari ( a leader of painters who worked for the Imperial Court ) of the Imperial Court , and Masanobu KANO of the Kanga ( a Chinese style of painting ) group , became two major forces in the art world .\\nIn 1482 , the former Shogun , Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA , started the construction of Higashiyama dono ( the predecessor of Ginkaku-ji Temple ) , and Masanobu took charge of the screen paintings .\\nFollowing the death of Yoshimasa in 1490 , Masanobu worked for the Hosokawa clan , which had political power at the time .\\nIn this way Masanobu solidified his position in the art world while deepening his relationship with the powers-that-be , and built a foundation for the subsequent prosperity of the Kanoha group .\\nAccording to records , it is known that Masanobu created works in various styles and subjects , including screen paintings and Buddhist paintings ; however , all his screen paintings have been lost and the existing works are limited to small paintings such as a hanging scroll .\\nHis painting style was \\' kanga , \\' with ink painting based on the brushwork of Sung and Yuan in China , in contrast to the traditional Yamatoe of his contemporary , Mitsunobu TOSA .\\nAlthough Masanobu lived until age 97 , it isn \\'t clear what work he produced during the last 30 years , and it seems he had his heir Motonobu assume the work of painting as he went into retirement .\\nThe second generation , Motonobu KANO ( 1476 - 1559 ) , who built the basis of prosperity of the Kanoha group , was the heir of Masanobu .\\nHis best existing works include the screen paintings in the hojo of Daisenin , Daitoku-ji Temple ( the hojo , or chief priest \\'s room , was completed in 1513 ) and another one in Reiunin , Myoshin-ji Temple in 1543 ( it is widely believed that the screen paintings in Daisenin were not created at the time the hojo was completed but were done in a slightly later period ) .\\nThe creation of the screen paintings in the hojo of Daisenin was divided among Soami , Motonobu and his brother Yukinobu KANO , depending on the room ; accordingly , Motonobu took charge of \" Four Seasons , Flowers and Birds \" in \\' Danna no Ma \\' and \" Founder of the Zenshu sect \" in \\' Ihatsu no Ma . \\'\\n\" Founder of Zenshu sect \" is a typical ink painting , while \" Four Seasons , Flowers and Birds \" is based on ink and shows a new flavor at the same time , as it uses colors only on the flowers and birds .\\nMotonobu strengthened the ties with the Ashikaga Shogun and the Hosokawa clan as the powers-that-be , had numerous disciples and consolidated the basis of the Kanoha as a group of painters .\\nHe accepted orders from court nobles , temples and shrines as well as samurai families ; and as for temples and shrines it is known that he created the screen paintings of Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple in Osaka according to the historical record , but this no longer exists .\\nBecause Motonobu referred to himself as \\' Echizen no kami \\' in his later life , he was given a priestly rank called \\' Hogen \\' however , for posterity he has been referred to as \\' Kohogen \\' or \\' Echizen Hogen . \\'\\nThe work is wide-ranging : he created the Engi Emaki of temples and shrines , votive pictures , gilded folding screens in the Yamatoe style , and portraits as well as screen paintings .\\nMotonobu assumed the Yamatoe painting style in Kanga and ink painting ( in which his father Masanobu specialized ) ; he specialized in large decorative paintings such as a Fusuma ( Japanese sliding door ) and a folding screen , and built a foundation for the style of the Kanoha group .\\nHe is also called the founder of the early modern screen paintings as he established the concept of calligraphy painting styles such as Shintai ( standard style ) , Gyotai ( semi-cursive style ) , and Sotai ( cursive style ) .\\nMotonobu had three sons : Munenobu , Hideyori and Naonobu ; Naonobu ( 1519 - 1592 ) ; the first , Munenobu , died young , and the third son Naonobu succeeded as the head of family .\\nIt is not clear why their family estate was transferred to the third son Naonobu instead of Hideyori , the second son .\\nNaonobu is widely known as Shoei KANO ( his posthumous name ) , and he was active from the Muromachi period to the Momoyama period .\\nThe huge \" Nirvana \" ( six meters long ) in Daitoku-ji Temple is his finest work .\\nAlthough he participated in the creation of the screen paintings for the Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple with his father Motonobu as well as in the creation of the screen paintings for the Jukoin , Daitoku-ji Temple with his son Eitoku , he was a less famous artist because his father Motonobu and his son Eitoku were more prominent .\\nEitoku KANO ( 1543 - 1590 ) , the heir of Shoei , is also called Kuninobu ; he is one of the most distinguished painters of the Japanese art world from the Momoyama period .\\nAlthough he created numbers of screen paintings in strict compliance with the plans of the men in power who had survived wild times--including Nobunaga ODA and Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI--these paintings were lost with the buildings , so relatively few of Eitoku \\'s works remain in existence .\\nThe paintings on the partitions in the hojo of Jukoin , Daitoku-ji Temple ( which are among his best existing works ) were created by Eitoku together with his father Shoei ; however , Shoei had Eitoku take charge of Fusumae of the major room in the south front of the hojo , while he took a supporting role .\\nIn the days of feudal society it was a common practice that the head of a family would create Fusumae in the major room , so it is historically believed that , at the time such paintings were created , Shoei had already retired after transferring the family estate to Eitoku , who was a great talent .\\n\" Flowers and Birds \" in Shitchu ( the center front room of Hojo ) is very highly acclaimed among the screen paintings of Hojo of Jukoin .\\nSubsequently , Eitoku became involved in the creation of the screen paintings in Azuchi Castle Tower , which Nobunaga ODA constructed during the period from 1576 to 1579 .\\nHe created screen paintings in the Osaka Castle of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and Jurakudai after Nobunaga died , and in his later years also became involved in creating the screen paintings in the Imperial Palace .\\nThese works were highly acclaimed for their originality in the journals and records of the time , so they would be Eitoku \\'s best works if they existed ; however , these paintings were lost with the buildings .\\nAs Eitoku \\'s existing best works , the screen paintings in the hojo of Jukoin , as previously described , are renowned as well as \" Foo dogs , folding screen \" as former imperial property , and \" Urban and suburb of Kyoto , folding screen , \" as handed down through the Uesugi clan ; it has also been said that \" Cypress , folding screen \" in the Tokyo National Museum was painted by Eitoku .\\nEitoku excelled at elaborate paintings and monumental paintings , although he had no choice but to paint in the monumental painting style in order to fill a large number of orders for screen paintings .\\nAn elaborate painting is interpreted as a work described in every detail , and monumental painting is interpreted as having a high-minded style .\\nThe Kanoha group also had the most important painters in the early modern ages .\\n\" Viewing Maple Leaves in Takao , \" a designated national treasure , has the seal of \\' Hideyori \\' ; it has been said that this was painted by Hideyori KANO ( birth and death dates unknown ) , the second son of Motonobu KANO ; however , it is also said that this \\' Hideyori \\' of \" Viewing Maple Leaves in Takao \" is another painter called Hideyori SHINSHO , a grandson of Motonobu .\\nSoshu KANO ( 1551 - 1601 ) was a brother of Eitoku , also called Motohide , and worked as an assistant to Eitoku in the creation of the screen paintings in Azuchi Castle .\\nFolding screens and portraits still in existence have been attributed to him .\\nNaganobu KANO ( 1577 - 1654 ) , another brother of Eitoku , is renowned as the painter of \" Playing Under the Flowering Trees , \" a national treasure .\\nAs painters other than the direct line of the Kano family , Yoshinobu KANO ( 1552 - 1640 ) , who painted \" Craftspeople , folding screen \" in Kawagoe Kitain , and Naizen KANO ( 1570 - 1616 ) , who painted \" Hokoku Festival , folding screen \" in Kyoto Toyokuni-jinja Shrine ( Kyoto City ) , are well known .\\nEitoku KANO died at age 48 , preceding his father Shoei ( Naonobu ) .\\nEitoku \\'s first son Mitsunobu KANO ( c . 1565 - 1608 ) and second son Takanobu KANO ( 1571 - 1618 ) succeeded him .\\nMitsunobu created the screen paintings in the Reception Hall of Kangakuin , Onjo-ji Temple ; in contrast to Eitoku he specialized in delicate painting in the Yamatoe style .\\nSuch a style of painting might not have suited the public taste at the time , and the early modern essays on paintings , including \" Honchogashi , \" generally put a low value on Mitsunobu .\\nAfter the death of the Kano ｆamily head Mitsunobu , his brother Takanobu led the Kanoha group because his son Sadanobu KANO ( 1597 - 1623 ) was only 12 years of age .\\nUnder the feudal system , the family line of Sadanobu , Mitsunobu \\'s first son , was supposed to be the head of family ; however , Sadanobu died without an heir at the age of just 27 , so after that the legitimacy of the Kano family was the descendant of Takanobu till the end of the Edo period .\\nTakanobu had three sons--Morinobu ( Tanyu 1602 - 1674 ) , Naonobu KANO ( 1607 - 1650 ) and Yasunobu KANO ( 1613 - 1685 ) --and they respectively became the earliest ancestor of the Kajibashi Kano family , Kobikicho Kano family and Nakabashi Kano family .\\nAlthough the youngest son , Yasunobu , succeeded as the Kano head of family as an adopted son of Sadanobu ( mentioned above ) , the most renowned painter was Morinobu ( also known as Tanyu ) .\\nMorinobu later became a priest and called himself Tanyusai ; as a painter he is known as Tanyu KANO .\\nHe eventually moved to Edo and solidified the position of the Kanoha group in the art world more as the official painter of the Edo shogunate .\\nTanyu exercised his painting talent from childhood ; in 1612 , he met Ieyasu TOKUNAGA in Sunpu at the age of 11 and obtained a residence in Edo Kajibashi Mongai in 1621 , subsequent to which he worked based in Edo and energetically created screen paintings in castles and large temples .\\nAmong Tanyu \\'s works , the screen paintings in the Edo and Osaka castles were lost with the buildings , but the screen paintings ( ink paintings ) in Jorakuden of Nagoya Castle are existent , having avoided an air raid during World War II because they had been removed from the building and evacuated ; additionally , the screen paintings in Ninomaru Palace of Nijo Castle and the hojo of Daitoku-ji Temple are among his best existent works .\\nHe created various kinds of works , including hanging rolls , picture scrolls and folding screens , as well as these large paintings .\\nHe created the screen paintings in Ninomaru Palace of Nijo Castle when he was young ( 25 years of age ) , and they showed dynamism in Eitoku \\'s style ; however , the screen paintings in Daitoku-ji Temple , which he created later in his life ( mainly with ink and water ) , display a calm approach with abundant use of blank space .\\nHe had works in the Yamatoe style in picture scrolls and folding screens as well .\\nTanyu emphasized sketches and the copying of ancient paintings ; consequently , he left numerous sketch books and reproduction books .\\nMany of Tanyu \\'s copies of ancient paintings ( called \\' Tanyu Reduction \\' ) are existent , which are now part of museums and collections around the nation , and they include many copies of ancient paintings whose originals are now lost , so they are valuable as data for the study of Japanese art history .\\nThe Kanoha group during the Edo period was a huge painting group comprised of a consanguinity group mainly with the head family of the Kano family and numerous disciples around the nation , thus comprising a hierarchy .\\nThey are clearly ranked : under the most prestigious four families ( called \\' inner court painters \\' ) there are about 15 families less prestigious called \\' outer court painters \\' and then the \\' Machi Kano painters \\' who catered to the demands of townspeople instead of the Imperial Court or temples and shrines ; and consequently their influence spread throughout the nation .\\nThe powers of the time sought the stability and continuity of feudal society , and the paintings for public places such as Edo Castle were supposed to be painted in the style of traditional painting examples ; they were not intended to be unique .\\nIn order to create numbers of screen paintings , one must work in a group with all the disciples ; therefore , in order to make group work easier , the ability to learn from painting examples was valued more than one \\'s individuality as a painter .\\nIn this respect it is undeniable that the paintings of the Kanoha group lack individuality and originality .\\nIt is said that the inner court painters ranked with Hatamoto and were allowed \\' audience \\' with the Shogun as well as belting on a sword , which implies a high status .\\nThe four families of the inner court painters are the Kajibashi family , with lineage of Tanyu ( the first son of Takanobu KANO ) ; the Kobikicho family ( called Takekawa-cho family at the time ) , with lineage of Naonobu ( the second son of Takanobu ) ; the Nakabashi family with lineage of Yasunobu ( the third son of Takanobu ) ; and the Hamacho family , with lineage of Minenobu KANO ( 1662 - 1708 ) ( Minenobu is the second son of Tsunenobu KANO , the first son of Naonobu KANO ) .\\nBecause Tanyu had no child , he adopted Toun ( Masunobu KANO 1625 - 1694 ) , the son of Ryujo GOTO , a swordsmith .\\nLater , Morimasa KANO ( 1653 - 1718 ) who was his biological son ( born after Tanyu turned 50 ) succeeded him , but subsequently this lineage had no distinguished painter .\\nAmong the numerous disciples of Tanyu , Morikage KUSUMI ( birth and death dates unknown ) , the creator of \" Enjoying the Cool of the Evening Under the Moonflower Trellis , \" is renowned .\\nMorikage was for some reason expelled from the Kanoha group ; he worked in the Kanazawa area later , but his records aren \\'t completely clear .\\nAs stated previously , the head family of Kano was succeeded by the Nakabashi Family of Yasunobu , a brother of Tanyu .\\nTokinobu KANO ( 1642 - 1678 ) , a son of Yasunobu , died in his thirties , and his son Ujinobu KANO ( 1675 - 1724 ) succeeded the family estate ; however , subsequently this lineage had no distinguished painter .\\nItcho HANABUSA ( 1652 - 1724 ) , who was popular based on his sophisticated painting style , was a disciple of Yasunobu .\\nThe family that produced relatively prominent painters until the end of the Edo period among the four families of the inner court painters is the Kobikicho family , of Naonobu \\'s lineage .\\nThis family line produced Tsunenobu KANO ( 1636 - 1713 ) , the heir of Naonobu , and Tsunenobu \\'s sons , Chikanobu KANO ( 1660 - 1728 ) and Minenobu KANO ( 1662 - 1708 ) .\\nMinenobu won the favor of the Shogun Ienobu TOKUGAWA , and he later gained independence as \\' Hamacho family , \\' which was ranked as one of the inner court painter families .\\nBesides them , Koi KANO ( date of birth unknown - 1636 ) was not related by blood to the Kano family but , along with his brothers , was a master of Tanyu ; he was allowed to use the surname of Kano due to his achievements , and he worked for the Kishu Tokugawa family .\\nMeanwhile , a group called \\' Kyo Kano \\' remained active in Kyoto , and Sanraku KANO ( 1559 - 1635 ) , a disciple of Eitoku KANO , was the pillar of the group .\\nSanraku was from the Kimura clan in Omi , the vassal of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI ; his original name was Mitsuyori KIMURA .\\nHis best works are \" Peonies \" and \" Red and White Plum Trees \" in the main house of Kyoto Daikaku-ji Temple , and they have colorful and decorative pictures on a golden base .\\nSansetsu KANO ( 1589 / 90 - 1651 ) , the husband of Sanraku \\'s daughter , created the screen paintings in Tenkyuin , Myoshin-ji Temple as well as some paintings of folding screens , which are still in existence .\\nHe had a distinctive painting style unique among painters of the Kanoha group , such as distinct shapes of trees and rocks , as well as the completeness of detail .\\nThe essay on paintings made by Sansetsu and edited by his son Eino KANO ( 1631 - 1697 ) is entitled \" Honchogashi , \" the first full-fledge painting history book by a Japanese .\\nThe Kobikicho family produced Michinobu KANO ( Michinobu EISENIN ( 1730 - 1790 ) ) , Korenobu KANO ( Korenobu YOSENIN ( 1753 - 1808 ) ) , Naganobu KANO ( Naganobu ISENIN ( 1775 - 1828 ) ) and Osanobu KANO ( Osanobu SEISENIN ( 1786 - 1846 ) ) during the late Edo period .\\nOsanobu SEISENIN led the creation of numerous screen paintings as a master of the Kanoha group during the reconstruction of the Nishinomaru and Honmaru palaces of Edo Castle , which had burned down in 1838 and again in 1844 .\\nAlthough the paintings are no longer in existence , numerous designs are in the possession of the Tokyo National Museum .\\nSEISENIN also endeavored to copy and collect ancient paintings .\\nAlthough the painters of the Kanoha group in the late Edo period are not well appreciated generally , there is a move to reappraise SEISENIN as the progress of the study after the late twentieth century recognizes that he was a painter with good technique who eagerly studied art from ancient paintings and on to the new painting movement at the end of the Edo period .\\nHogai KANO ( born in Shimonoseki , 1828 - 1888 ) , a leading figure of the Japanese art world during the early Meiji period , like Gaho HASHIMOTO ( born in Kawagoe , 1835 - 1908 ) , was a disciple of Tadanobu KANO ( Tadanobu SHOSEN \\'IN 1823 - 1880 ) , the next generation of SEISENIN .\\nBoth Hogai and Gaho were from painter families of the Kanoha group .\\nThe historical role of the Kanoha group as a professional painter group finished as its patron , the Edo shogunate , ended .\\nPersonal information of Emperor SHIRAKAWA\\nEmperor SHIRAKAWA ( 7th July 1053 - 24th July 1129 ) was the 72nd Emperor .\\nSHIRAKAWA came to power on the 18th January 1073 and reigned until 5th anuary 1087 .\\nHis posthumous name was Sadahito .\\nSHIRAKAWA was the first son of Emperor Go-Sanjo who had little maternal relationship with the Fujiwara Five Regent Houses , and his mother , Nyogo , FUJIWARA no Moshi / Shigeko was from Fujiwara Kaninryu , the daughter of Chunagon FUJIWARA no Kinnari , and the adopted daughter of Togu Daibu FUJIWARA no Yoshinobu .\\nHis half sister was Princess Tokushi / Atsuko ( Empress of Horikawa )\\nGenealogy\\nWhen he was young , he and his father were snubbed due to their background , but after his father was enthroned in 1068 ( Jiryaku 4 ) , he was proclaimed a Shinno ( Imperial prince ) and became Imperial Prince Sadahito .\\nIn 1069 he became Crown Prince , and became an Emperor three years later , when he was twenty years old .\\nA Kanpaku was assigned , but SHIRAKAWA attempted to rule directly like his father had done , after his father , the retired Emperor , died of illness in 1070 ( Jiryaku 5 ) , and also attempted to regulate the Shoen ( manor ) system thereby trying to weaken the influence of the Regent / Kanpaku Houses .\\nGo-Sanjo-in and Go-Sanjo-in \\'s mother , Yomeimon-in , wished for SHIRAKAWA \\'s younger half brother , Prince Sanehito ( Heian period ) and then Sanehito \\'s younger brother Prince Sukehito to succeed to the throne , and upon abdication to SHIRAKAWA , Prince Sanehito was decided to become Crown Prince .\\nSHIRAKARA repelled against this and later Prince Sanehiro died from illness in 1085 ( Otoku 2 ) .\\nAs a result , in November , 1086 ( Otoku 3 ) , SHIRAKAWA proclaimed his own eight year old son , Prince Taruhito ( 73rd Emperor Horikawa ) to be the Crown Prince instead of Prince Sukehito and SHIRAKAWA abdicated immediately .\\nRetired Emperor SHIRAKAWA , who became Daijo Tenno , acted as the guardian of the young Emperor , and ruled personally as Shirakawa-in , and this style of government became known as Insei system ( cloistered style ) .\\nThrough such system , although the Sessho and Kampaku offices continued , they did not have actual power to rule the government .\\nSHIRAKAWA continued to have exert power even after Emperor Horikawa turned twenty years old and he strengthened his despotic position by appointing aids from the Juryro and Samurai class .\\nThe Samurai soldiers were assigned to such posts as the \" Hokumen no bushi \" which was newly established to protect the retired Emperor .\\nSHIRAKAWA was a strict Buddhist and he became a Cloistered Emperor with posthumous Buddhist name of Yukan after the death of his daughter in 1096 ( Kaho 3 ) .\\nSHIRAKAWA ordered the building of many temples and Buddhist statues including the Hossho-ji Temple , and he took advantage of getting finance from Juryo .\\nAfter Emperor Horikawa died , SHIRAKAWA ruled using a cloistered government for forty three years through three generations of young Emperors , until he died on 24th July 1129 ( 7th July Taiji 4 ) , and he supported both his grandson 74th Emperor Toba and his great grandson 75th Emperor Sutoku .\\nThis is called \" Chiten no kimi \" .\\nThe Cloistered Emperor Shirakawa had supreme power , but it was said he mented that , he has no control over the following three things : 1 . Waters of the Kamo River ( tributary of the Yodo River ) ( due to its flow and frequent flooding ) ; 2 . Dice used in sugoroku ( different from current sugoroku , close to western backgammon ) , which was popular way of gambling at that time , with spots on the dice selecting winners / losers ; and 3 . Yamaboshi ( monk soldiers from Mt . Hie Enryaku-ji Temple ) , which show that SHIRAKAWA had absolute control apart from these three things .\\nSHIRAKAWA is also known for many relationships with women and the rumor that Emperor Sutoku and TAIRA no Kiyomori may be SHIRAKAWA \\'s illegitimate sons , was widely spread and believed at the time .\\nEmpress , FUJIWARA no Kenshi / Kataiko ( 1057-1084 ) - the daughter of MINAMOTO no Akifusa and adopted daughter of FUJIWARA no Morozane\\nPrince Atsufumi ( 1074-1077 )\\nPrincess Teishi / Yasuko ( Ikuhoumon-in ) , ( 1076-1096 ) , Saigu\\nPrincess Reishi / Yoshiko ( 1078-1144 ) , Saiin\\nPrince Taruhito ( Emperor Horikawa ) ( 1079-1107 )\\nPrincess Shinshi / Yoshiko ( Tsuchimikadosaiin ) ( 1081-1156 )\\nNyogo : FUJIWARA no Doshi / Michiko ( 1042-1132 ) was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Yoshinaga\\nPrincess Yoshiko ( Rokkaku Saigu ) .

They held the lordship of Karoku , an area of land that yielded 2,000 koku of rice in the Edo era and 3,000 koku later on , until the Meiji era .\\nSetsuko , the fourth daughter of the duke Michitaka KUJO , who was Hisatada KUJO \\'s firstborn , became empress to the Emperor Taisho ( Empress Teimei ) .\\nConflict over legitimate blood between the Kujo and Ichijo families\\nMichiie KUJO lost the legitimate heir , Norizane KUJO , and the second son , Yoshizane KUJO , was practically repudiated .\\nMichiie gave Tadaie KUJO , Norizane \\'s son and Michiie \\'s grandchild , to be the legitimate heir , a shobunjo ( a kind of will ) to give instructions that documents such as diaries ( which were the most important heritage for a court noble at the time ) should be inherited by the Ichijo Family , but that the head of a family who controls the family temples such as Tofuku-ji Temple should first be inherited by Sanetsune ICHIJO , the third son of Michiie , then by Tadaie KUJO , a child of the eldest son of Michiie , and later by either descendant of the Kujo Family or the Ichijo Family who took the highest-ranking official position ( head of a clan ) .\\nIn accordance with Michiie \\'s will , Sanetsune ICHIJO \\'s descendant inherited the position as head of the family after Michiie died .\\nThereafter , the predominance of the Ichijo Family was maintained for over 100 years , whereby the position of the Ichijo Family as legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu ( Kujo family line ) was well established .\\nWhen Tsunemichi ICHIJO died in 1365 ( the Hokucho period ) , during the Muromachi era , Tsunenori KUJO--who had gained the second position of power after the Ichijo Family--made an appeal to the Emperor Gokogon that Fusatsune ICHIJO , a son of Tsunemichi , had fraudulently identified himself as the head of family .\\nAt that time , primogeniture was becoming the common practice , and Tsunenori claimed that according to primogeniture the Kujo Family , the descendant of the eldest son of Michiie , should inherit the family estate .\\nFusatsune ICHIJO argued against Tsunenori , stating that just because an ancestor of the Kujo Family was the firstborn child it did not mean the Kujo Family was the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu , and that because Michiie KUJO gave the family estate to Sanetsune ICHIJO , the Tokado-bunko ( Gonnjo-moromichi-ki ) ( Gonijo-moromichi record ) , Gyokuyo ( Kanezane KUJO \\'s diary ) and Gyokuzui ( Michiie KUJO \\'s diary ) ) and the document endorsing the political authority of Kujo-ryu Sekkan-ke , a regent family , were inherited by the ICHIJO Family ; whereas Tsunenori KUJO asserted that measures to give inheritance to Sanetsune were taken just because Tadaie KUJO was in infancy , and that if Norizane KUJO had lived longer it would not have happened .\\nTunenori further asserted that Tadaie KUJO was named as the receiver of the shobunjo ( executor of the will ) and the land patent of the premise of Tofuku-ji Temple had been inherited by the Kujo Family because the Kujo was the legitimate blood .\\nConsidering the political position of the Kujo Family at that time , the emperor gave Rinji to the Kujo Family on November 29 ( lunar calendar ) , in the same year giving the verdict that the will of Michiie was no more than the inheritance of the head of a family by the head of a clan and that the Kujo and Ichijo families , both having the qualification , were on equal footing as legitimate blood .\\nThe Ichijo Family was the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu during the Kamakura era , but after the middle Muromachi period the position of the Kujo Family was elevated and the Ichijo and Kujo families were considered to be the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu .\\nThe Kujo Family started inheriting the Matsudono Family \\'s fiefdom after the Middle Edo period ; thus the Kujo possessed the largest Kokudaka , lived in a huge house and claimed to be the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu .\\nKanezane KUJO ( 1149-1207 )\\nYoshitsune KUJO ( 1169-1206 )\\nMichiie KUJO ( 1193-1252 )\\nNorizane KUJO ( 1210-1235 )\\nYoritsune KUJO ( 1218-1256 )\\nYoritsugu KUJO ( 1239-1256 )\\nHisatada KUJO ( 1798-1871 )\\nOld Kujo-tei was in the southwest area of the present-day Kyoto Gyoen .\\nToday only the garden remains , on the basis of maintenance .\\nItsukushima-jinja Shrine , which was then called Chinju-sha , still exists on the island of the garden pond ( KUJO-ike ) , and a simple but elegant tearoom called Shusui-tei is found near the pond .\\nThe major buildings ( such as the main building ) were transferred to Kujo-tei in Tokyo in accordance with the order issued during the early Meiji era , and were recently donated by the Kujo Family to the Tokyo National Museum , which was named Kujo-kan .\\nYamashiro no Kuni , located in Kinai , was one of the administrative province ( Ryoseikoku ) .\\nIt was situated in the southern part of present day Kyoto .\\nIt was also called Joshu ( unusually it is also alled Sanshu ) or Yoshu .\\nIn the Engishiki , it is ranked as Kokushi-kuni tokyu ( a Kokushi ( official ) governing province ) .\\n\" Yamashiro \" was written as 山代 in ancient times , and in the 7th century , the province ( kuni ) was founded with the name written as 山背国 .\\nOn November 8 , 794 ( Enryaku 13 ) , when the capital was named Heian-kyo ( Heian Palace ) , the Emperor Kammu changed the second letter of the province \\'s name to 山城国\\nBased on the writings of \" mokkan \" － strips of wood used for writing during the Heijo-kyo ( Heijo Palace ) period , the notations of Yamashiro no Kuni as 山代国 and 山背国 seem to have coexisted with 山城国 .\\nAccording to Wamyo Ruijusho , the provincial government office ( Kokufu ) was situated at the Kaya Imperial Villa ( Kaya Detached Palace ) .\\nOn the other hand , it is recorded as \" Otokuni-gun ( Otokuni District ) , Fu ( Office ) \" in Shugaisho .\\nIn the colophon and afterward titled \" Keicho-two Enirinshi \" of Setsuyoshu ( proofed by Ekirin ) it is also recorded as \" Otokuni-gun ( Otokuni District ) , Fu ( Office ) . \"\\nAs for Shugosho ( governor \\'s office ) , at first , the mansion of the Gokenin of Kyoto Shugo ( Kyoto governor ) was designated because the person holding the post of Kyoto Shugo concurrently took charge of Yamashiro Province \\'s Shugo .\\nLater , Rokuhara Tandai held the post of the Province Shugo , and therefore , the office ( Shugosho ) was moved to Rokuhara .\\nIn Muromachi period , the Yamashiro Province was divided along the Uji River into three upper districts and five lower districts ; after an associate shugo ( shugodai ) was designated to each district the Shugosho in charge of the three upper districts was situated in Uji Makishima , while Shugosho for the five lower districts were placed in several places such as Yodo .\\nIchinomiya ( primary shrine ) , Provincial monastery ( temple ) , and Others\\nThe provincial temple － with monastery for priests as well as convent for priestess － , were located in Soraku District .\\nThe Daigokuden Hall of the Kuni no Miya Shrine was designated as a monastery ( soji ) in 746 .\\nIt was burned down in 882 .\\nAfterwards it was reconstructed but its influence declined .\\nIn Kamakura period , it seems that the temple was categorized as the lowest level temple within the Byodo-in school\\nThe provincial temple was located at present day Kamo-cho , Kizugawa city .\\nIn 1925 ( 14th year of Taisho ) a large number of old [ roof ] tiles were excavated near the provincial temple , and implying that there was a convent there .\\nIn Engi-Shiki Jinmei-cho ( shrines \\' name directory ) a total of 122-za and 96-sha are recorded , consisting of 53-za / 37-sha of taisha ( big shrines ) ( within these shrines , 23-za / 16-sha of dai myojin are included ) and 69-za / 59-sha of shosha ( small shrines ) .

10 in the KONDO squad and 24 in the HIJIKATA squad ( There are different views on the number. cf . List of Soldiers Involved ) .\\nThe HIJIKATA squad , a part of the Shinsen-gumi , searched Nawate Street from Yasaka Shrine , while the KONDO squad searched Kiyamachi Street across the Sanjo Bridge .\\nAt the end of the search , the KONDO squad found radical nationalists who were having a meeting at Ikedaya .\\nA few members of the KONDO squad attacked them and got into a battle in the middle of the night .\\nFour of the members - Isami KONDO , Soji OKITA , Shinpachi NAGAKURA , and Heisuke TODO - first attacked the 20-some radical nationalists while the rest shored up the perimeter .\\nSome ronins frantically attacked Hayatarou ANDO , Eisuke OKUZAWA and Kakuzaemon NITTA who guarded the back door , and succeeded to escape .\\nOKUZAWA died in the attack , and ANDO and NITTA died a month later .\\nOKITA went inside the building and fought hard , but collapsed during the battle and withdrew from it .\\nSome accounts say that this was because of a tuberculosis-related blood spitting , but there is a lot of doubt and it is not certain .\\nThen , a sword hit the forehead of TODO on the first floor when sweat caused his helmet to slip out of place , and he withdrew from the battle .\\nAlthough there were KONDO and NAGAKURA only at one point , the arrival of the HIJIKATA squad tilted the odds in favor of the Shinsen-gumi and achieved a result of nine people killed and four arrested .\\nAizu and Kuwana clans arrived there to support them after the battle .\\nHIJIKATA would not let them anywhere near , to ensure that they could not take credit .\\nAlthough some of the radical nationalists escaped from the battle , the next morning more than 20 people were arrested by carrying out clearing operations with Aizu , Kuwana , and other clans .\\nThe sweep of the city turned violent , and there were 5 immediate deaths among the Aizu clan , four among the Hikone clan , and two among the Kuwana clan .\\nAt noon of the following day , the Shinsen-gumi returned to their base in Mibu Village . ( If they had returned to their base at night , they might have fallen into an ambush , so they took a rest in the city until dawn . )\\nIt is said that the roadside was crowded with onlookers .\\nThe name of the Shinsen-gumi , which succeeded in preventing the plot to burn down the imperial palace , became famous throughout the land .\\nThe \" revere the emperor , expel foreigners \" faction , on the other hand , took a big blow with the deaths of such important activists as Toshimaro YOSHIDA , Kichima KITAZOE , Teizo MIYABE , Matajiro OTAKA , Junjiro ISHIKAWA , Matsusuke SUGIYAMA and Jusuke MATSUDA . ( They were later called the \" Seven Martyrs \" by the new government . )\\nKogoro KATSURA ( later Takayoshi KIDO ) should have been there too , but he arrived earlier and then went back to the base to wait a while . His life had been spared because the incident occurred before he came back .\\nBeginning with this incident , the Choshu clan fell under the influence of zealots and later came to Kyoto and raised the Kinmon rebellion on July 19 ( in the old calendar ) .\\nIt has been said that the Ikedaya Incident delayed the Meiji Restoration by a year . There is also another opinion that it sped up the Restoration by stirring up the \" revere the emperor , expel foreigners \" faction .\\nAuthor Ryotaro SHIBA \\'s interpretation is that the Meiji Restoration led by the four major clans of Satsuma , Choshu , Tosa , and Bizen would never have happened without this incident .\\nThe following Shinsen-gumi soldiers fought in the Ikedaya Incident .

like the moon goes behind a cloud at a blow \\' was selected for \" Ogura Hyakunin isshu ( One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets ) . \"\\nShe was from the Fujiwara clan , and her name as a court lady was \\' Fuji Shikibu ( Murasaki Shikibu ) . \\'\\nShe acquired the sobriquet of \\' Murasaki \\' from the name of the heroine \\' Murasaki no Ue \\' of \" The Tale of Genji , \" and \\' Shikibu \\' refers to her father \\'s position as Shikibutaijo ( Aide of Ceremonials ) .\\nMurasaki Shikibu \\'s real name is unknown , but it is assumed that she was the \\' FUJIWARA no Kaoriko / Takako / Koshi , \\' who became shoji ( ranked ) on January 29 , 1007 , which was described in \\' Mido Kanpakuki ( FUJIWARA no Michinaga \\'s diary ) . \\'\\nHowever this view is generally based on the other assumptions , which are said to contain errors in the process of making inferences , so it remains a matter of conjecture .\\nAlso , her dates of birth and death are unknown , but it is suggested that she was about 30 years old in 1008 , based on historical materials and her works ; by counting backwards from that age , she would have been born around 979 and died around 1016 .\\nTradition has it that she liked sardines , which was unusual for aristocracy , but this episode is based on a story of Izumi Shikibu in \\' Sarugenji no soshi ( The Sarugenji Book ) , \\' so it seems to have been made up by someone at a later date .\\nShe was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tametoki , governor of Echigo Province , and her mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tamenobu from Settsu Province , but she lost her mother when she was little .\\nFUJIWARA no Nobunori was her brother by a different father , and apparently she also had an older sister .\\nFUJIWARA no Sadakata , Sanjo Udaijin ( Sanjo minister of the right ) , and FUJIWARA no Kanesuke , Tsutsumi Chunagon ( vice-councilor of state ) , were her paternal great grandfathers , and she had many relatives who were known as talented writers .\\nThere are many anecdotes stating that , since her childhood , she had had more talent for reading Chinese classics than women were required to have in those days .\\nIt is generally considered that she wrote both \" The Tale of Genji , \" which consists of 54 chapters , and \" Murasaki Shikibu Diary , \" which was about her days in service to the Imperial Court , as well as \" Collection of Murasaki Shikibu \\'s Works . \"\\nHer father , FUJIWARA no Tametoki , obtained employment as a reader in Togu ( the palace of the Crown Prince ) while in his thirties , and when the Crown Prince became Emperor Kazan he was promoted to the post of kurodo ( Chamberlain ) and then to Shikibutaijo ; however , when the Emperor became a priest , he lost his job .\\nTen years later , as a consequence of dedicating a poem to Emperor Ichijo , he became a governor of Echizen Province .\\nMurasaki Shikibu , during her childhood , spent two years in the place of her father \\'s assignment .\\nIn about 998 , she married a governor of Yamashiro Province FUJIWARA no Nobutaka , who was old enough to be her father ; in 999 she bore him a daughter , FUJIWARA no Kataiko / Kenshi , but this marriage life didn \\'t last long because Nobutaka died soon afterward .\\nIn December 29 ( according to the lunar calendar ) of 1005 , she began serving the Empress of Emperor Ichijo FUJIWARA no Shoshi / Akiko ( the oldest daughter of FUJIWARA no Michinaga , and later given the name of the Retired Emperor Jotomonin ) as a court lady-cum-tutor , and she served the Empress at least until 1011 .\\nThere is a poem created by ISE no Taifu , \\' Some time ago , double-flowered cherry trees bloomed in the colorful capital of Nara ;

however , according to \" ISE no Taifu shu ( Private Collection ) \" it was supposed to be a duty of Murasaki Shikibu , but she delegated the duty to a newcomer , Taifu .\\nThe last description about Murasaki Shikibu appears in \" Shoyuki , \" the diary of FUJIWARA no Sanesuke , dated May 25 ( lunar calendar ) 1014 , saying that \\' as \" a daughter of Tametoki , who was a governor of Echigo Province , \" she conveyed a message from the wife of the Retired Empress Shoshi to Sanesuke . \\'\\nTherefore it is widely believed that she died between 1012 and 1016 , in the reign of Emperor Sanjo , but some people disagree .\\nAlso , tradition has it that Murasaki Shikibu \\'s grave can be found at Murasaki no Nishigoshoden-cho ( Horikawa Kitaoji Kudaru , West side ) , Kita Ward , Kyoto City .\\nToday , the Bank of Japan \\'s D-note of 2,000 yen has a portrait of Murasaki Shikibu and a part of \" The Tale of Genji Emaki ( picture scroll ) \" on its back side .\\nHer name appeared in the great historical figures calendar of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( = UNESCO ) , and she was the only Japanese to be thus enrolled .\\nYou can read some comments about her contemporary famous court ladies .\\nAbove all , a comment about Sei Shonagon , the author of The Pillow Book , is the most famous ( the following is a free translation ) :\\nSei Shonagon is a jerk who acts proudly .

Senjosan in Hoki Province , Takauji , the powerful vassal of the Kamakura shogunate , was sent to Kyoto leading the main armies of the shogunate to put down the rebellion , but he switched sides and gathered an army against the shogunate at Shinomura Hachimangu in Tamba Province to capture Rokuhara Tandai .\\nHis achievements were evaluated by Emperor Go-Daigo , and he was awarded the letter ( 尊 ) , which came from the emperor \\'s real name Takaharu ( 尊治 ) , so he changed the letter in his name from \" 高氏 \" to \" 尊氏 \" .\\nWhile the despotic Kenmu restoration by Emperor Go-Daigo had been losing support , Takauji traveled to the east to suppress the Nakasendai Rebellion , and stayed in Kamakura to try to build his own government .\\nBecause of this , the relationship between Takauji and the imperial court came to an impasse , and he returned to Kyoto , driving the Emperor Go-Daigo out to Mt . Hiei . However , the Emperor \\'s army made a counterattack and Takauji fled to Kyushu temporarily .\\nHe reentered Kyoto and established a new samurai government called the Muromachi Shogunate , being appointed Seii Taishogun by Grand Emperor ( Retired Emperor ) Kogon and Emperor Komyo .\\nAt the same time , Emperor Go-Daigo moved to Yoshino and set up the Southern Court there .\\nAfter he established the Muromachi Shogunate , he and his brother Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA divided power between them , but in later years discord between them increased until the Kanno Disturbance .\\nThe disturbance subsided with the death of Tadayoshi , but even after that Takauji had to keep fighting against his enemies , such as the Southern Court forces , to maintain his government .\\nAfter Emperor Go-Daigo died , Takauji built Tenryu-ji Temple to pray for the dead .\\nBecause of his rebellion against the emperor , people had branded him as a traitor since the Meiji era , but after World War II they began to look at him more positively , which illustrates how much the historical point of view affects the way we look at the people in history .\\nFrom Birth to the Fall of the Kamakura Shogunate\\nTakauji was born in 1305 .\\nThere are 3 presumptions about his birthplace : Ayabe ( Uesugisho in Ayabe City , Kyoto ) , Kamakura and Ashikagano sho ( Ashikaga City , Tochigi Prefecture ) .\\n\" Nan-Taiheiki \" says that when Takauji was given his first bath , two turtledoves flew in ; one perched on his shoulder , and the other on the dipper .\\nHis childhood name was Matataro .\\nOn October 10th , 1319 , his coming-of-age ceremony ( Genpuku ) was held at age 15 , and he was appointed Jibutaifu of the Fifth Rank , Junior Grade , and given the name Takauji by the regent Takatoki HOJO .\\nTakauji \\'s father Sadauji and his official wife Shakado , daughter of Akitoki HOJO , had the first son Takayoshi ASHIKAGA , but he died early and Takauji succeeded to his father .\\nAccording to \" Nan-Taiheiki \" , Ietoki ASHIKAGA , Takauji \\'s grandfather , killed himself with his sword , praying that the Ashikaga clan may rule over the whole country in 3 generations .\\nIn 1331 , Emperor Go-Daigo plotted the overthrow of the shogunate again and raised an army at Kasagi ( Genko Incident ) .\\nThe Kamakura shogunate ordered Takauji , who had been a powerful vassal , to help the shogunate , and he joined the battles at Kasagi where the emperor was based and at Shimoakasaka Castle in which Masashige KUSUNOKI was based .\\nThe incident had taken place just after his father \\'s death , so Takauji at first had refused his help to the shogunate , but the Kamakura shogunate took his wife and children as hostages to make Takauji follow its order .\\nAccording to \" Koten-Taiheiki , \" because of this Takauji began to harbor hostility toward the shogunate .\\nAs a result of the attack against the emperor made by the shogunate , the emperor and his followers such as Toshimoto HINO and Enkan were captured , and the following year Emperor Go-Daigo was exiled to Oki Islands ( Genko Rebellion ) .\\nThe shogunate installed Emperor Kogon of the Jimyo-in line as emperor , instead of Emperor Go-Daigo of the Daikaku-ji line .\\nIn the following year , Emperor Go-Daigo escaped from Oki Islands , and raised an army at Mt . Senjosan .\\nTakauji was ordered to reenter Kyoto with Takaie NAGOE to put down the rebellion in the west .\\nTakaie was killed by Norimura AKAMATSU , which made Takauji decide to side with the emperor . On April 29th of the same year , he raised an army against the shogunate at Shinomura Hachimangu ( present Kameoka City , Kyoto ) in Tamba Province .\\nTakauji gathered forces from various provinces , and entered Kyoto followed by vassals such as Doyo SASAKI from Omi Province , and then succeeded in destroying Rokuhara Tandai on May 7th , 1333 .\\nAt about the same time , Yoshisada NITTA , vassal of Kozuke Province , also gathered an army , and destroyed the shogunate , taking Takauji \\'s heir Senjuo ( later called Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA ) , who had escaped from Kamakura , with him .\\nIn this fighting , Takewakamaru , the son of Takauji \\'s concubine , was killed .\\nAfter the Kamakura shogunate was crumbled , Takauji ordered Kazuuji HOSOKAWA , Yoriharu HOSOKAWA and Morouji HOSOKAWA to make Yoshisada NITTA return to Kyoto , and let the Ashikaga clan rule Kamakura .\\nAfter the fall of the Kamakura shogunate , Emperor Go-Daigo considered Takauji \\'s work to be commendable , and gave him the ranks of Chinjufu Shogun and Sahyoe no Kami with the courtly title of Fourth Rank , Junior Grade , along with 30 plots of land .\\nIn addition to that , he was given the letter ( 尊 ) , which came from the emperor \\'s given name , and changed the letter of his name Takauji ( 高氏 ) into Takauji ( 尊氏 ) .\\nUnder the Kenmu administration , Takauji left politics and let KO no Moronao , the regent of the Ashikaga clan , and KO no Moroyasu engage in politics , while he made his brother Tadayoshi the regent of the Kamakura Shogunfu .\\nThere are two interpretations of Takauji \\'s behavior ; one is that it was Emperor Go-Daigo who made Takauji leave politics , and the other is that it was Takauji who tried to keep away from the government .\\nThere is also a different presumption that Takauji intended to establish the new government in Kamakura .\\nThis condition was called \" Takauji \\'s absence in the new government \" .\\nWhile Emperor Go-Daigo appointed Akiie KITABATAKE as Chinjufu Shogun and made him take Prince Noriyoshi ( later called Emperor GO-Murakami ) to Oshu in order to pacify the place , Takauji made Tadayoshi lead young Prince Narinaga ( Nariyoshi ) down to Kamakura .\\nEmperor Go-Daigo \\'s son Prince Morinaga , who also coveted the title of Seii Taishogun , gradually came to rival Takauji , and plotted to assassinate him , but Takauji \\'s security was so tight that he failed to do it .\\nIn 1334 , Takauji captured and confined Prince Morinaga , who was in conflict with the emperor too , to Tadayoshi \\'s place in Kamakura , conspiring with the emperor \\'s mistress Yasuko ( Kadoko ) ANO , who wanted to make her son Prince Tsunenaga ( Tsuneyoshi ) a crown prince .\\nIn 1335 , Nakasendai Rebellion was raised in Shinano Province by the survivors of the HOJO clan , taking Tokiyuki HOJO , bereaved son of Takatoki HOJO , with them , and Tokiyuki \\'s army occupied Kamakura temporarily .\\nIn the rebellion , Tadayoshi killed Prince Morinaga without permission .\\nTakauji requested that Emperor Go-Daigo appoint him Seii Taishogun only to be rejected , so he marched to Kamakura without emperor \\'s permission on August 2nd of the same year , which made Emperor Go-Daigo reluctantly appoint him as Seito Taishogun .\\nTadayoshi \\'s army , joined by Takauji , defeated Tokiyuki HOJO at the Battle of Sagamigawa and regained Kamakura on the 19th of the same month .\\nTakauji was given the courtly title of the Second Rank .\\nWith Tadayoshi \\'s approval , Takauji established a base in Kamakura and began to allot lands to his followers , ignoring the emperor \\'s command to return to Kyoto , and he tried to establish his own samurai government .\\nIn November , Takauji suggested to the emperor that Yoshisada NITTA was an enemy of the imperial court and should be killed , but on the contrary the emperor ordered Yoshisada to kill Takauji , making Yoshisada take Prince Takanaga ( Takayoshi ) to Kamakura along Tokaido .\\nBesides that , Akiie KITABATAKE began to go down to Kyoto from Oshu , so Takauji declared his retirement to get a reprieve . However , once the Ashikaga side , including Tadayoshi and KO no Moronao , began to lose at various provinces such as Mikawa , Takauji decided to revolt against the Kenmu government .\\nIn December of the same year , Takauji defeated Nitta \\'s army at the Battle of Hakone Take no Shita , and advanced his army up to Kyoto .\\nDuring that time , Takauji secretly made contact with Emperor Kogon of the Jimyo-in line to justify his entering Kyoto .\\nIn the following month , Takauji reached Kyoto , while Emperor GO-Daigo fled to Mt . Hiei .\\nShortly thereafter , Takauji was attacked in Kyoto by the armies of Akiie KITABATAKE , Masashige KUSUNOKI and Yoshisada NITTA from Oshu , and he gave up Kyoto , accepting Enshin AKAMATSU \\'s advice to leave for Kyushu .\\nOn his way down to Kyushu , Yoshinao ( Yorihisa ) SHONI came to meet him at Akamagaseki , Nagato Province ( present Shimonoseki City , Yamaguchi Prefecture ) , and he was supported by Ujinori MUNAKATA , the chief priest of Munakata Taisha Shrine in Munakata , Chikuzen Province .\\nIn the beginning of March , after visiting Munakata Taisha , Takauji defeated Taketoshi KIKUCHI ( Emperor Go-Daigo \\'s side ) at the Battle of Tatarahama ( present Fukuoka City ) , and on his way up to Kyoto , he got Emperor Kogon \\'s order and immediately gathered western warriors .\\nHe smashed the armies of Yoshisada NITTA and Masashige KUSUNOKI at the Battle of Minatogawa on April 25th of the same year , and seized Kyoto again in June .\\nTakauji attempted a reconciliation with Emperor Go-Daigo , who had been at Mt . Hiei , to save face for the emperor .\\nEmperor Go-Daigo , accepting Takauji \\'s offer , transferred the Imperial Regalia of Japan to Emperor Komyo , a younger brother of Grand Emperor Kogon , and right after that , on November 7th , Takauji declared the opening of a new samurai government , setting the Kenmu Shikimoku in order to show the basic policy of his government to his people .\\nEmperor Go-Daigo escaped from Kyoto to Yoshino ( present Yoshino-cho , Yoshino-gun , Nara Prefecture ) taking the Imperial Regalia of Japan with him in December , and announced that the transferred regalia were fake , so he established Yoshino Imperial Court ( = Southern Court ) .\\nIn 1338 , Takauji was appointed Seii Taishogun ( reigned 1338-58 ) by Emperor Komyo , which meant that an actual samurai government later called Muromachi Shogunate was established .\\nIn the following year , when Emperor Go-Daigo passed away in Yoshino , Takauji began to found Tenryu-ji temple to pray for the soul of the dead emperor .\\nIn order to raise the funds to build the temple , a trading vessel called Tenryu-ji-bune was set sail for Yuan Dynasty .\\nUnder the new government , Takauji gave Tadayoshi a post as administrative leader and he himself became the leader of the house vassals .\\nShin \\'ichi Sato called such conditions diarchy by Takauji , who held a military power in the lord-and-vassal relationship , and Tadayoshi , who controlled the judicial functions of the regime , in his essay \\' Muromachi Bakufu \\' in \" Iawanami Koza Nihon Rekishi vol.7 \" ( Iawanami Publishing , 1963 ) and explained that the potentiality of the shogun \\'s dual power which had continued since Kamakura Shogunate , came to appear .\\nThe dual power gradually led to a conflict between anti-Tadayoshi group represented by KO no Moronao , and the Tadayoshi group in the government .\\nThis conflict finally raised an internal split called the Kanno Disturbance .\\nAt first Takauji took a neutral stance on it , but he came to side with Moronao \\'s group .\\nIn 1349 , Moronao demanded Tadayoshi \\'s retirement from politics , surrounding Takauji \\'s castle in which Tadayoshi had sheltered .\\nTadayoshi became a priest and lost his power , but it is said that Moronao and Takauji made an arrangement to exclude Tadayoshi .\\nWhile Takauji called back his heir Yoshiakira from Kamakura to put him in charge of political affairs instead of Tadayoshi , he sent his second son Motouji ASHIKAGA to Kamakura in return and set the Kamakurafu to rule the eastern provinces , appointing Motouji Kamakura kubo .\\nAfter Tadayoshi \\'s retreat , Takauji \\'s illegitimate son - also Tadayoshi \\'s adopted son - Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA was enlarging his power as a member of the Tadayoshi faction in Kyushu , so Takauji made an expedition to Chugoku District to kill Tadafuyu in 1350 .\\nThen Tadayoshi escaped from Kyoto and sided with the Southern Court , followed by a few of the devoted military commanders such as Tadatsune MOMONOI and Kunikiyo HATAKEYAMA .\\nWhen Tadayoshi \\'s army grew stronger , Yoshiakira became powerless and fled from Kyoto . Takauji was also defeated by Tadayoshi \\'s army at Uchidehama in Settsu Province ( present Nishinomiya City , Hyogo Prefecture ) .\\nTakauji sought reconciliation with Tadayoshi on condition that the KO brothers would become priests , and they came to an agreement in 1351 .\\nThe KO brothers were assassinated by Yoshinori UESUGI while they were under escort .\\nTadayoshi became Yoshiakira \\'s assistant and got involved in political affairs again .\\nTakauji and Yoshiakira marched to Harima Province on the ostensible purpose to put down the revolt plotted by Doyo SASAKI and Sokuyu ( Norisuke ) AKAMATSU , but in reality they attempted a reconciliation with the Southern Court , conspiring to kill Tadayoshi and Tadafuyu .\\nSensing this conspiracy , Tadayoshi fled to the northern area and reached Kamakura .\\nIn October of the same year , Takauji and the Southern Court reconciled , an event that was called Shohei-itto .\\nAt the same time , Takauji chased Tadayoshi along the Tokaido , and defeated him at the battles of Mt . Satsutamayama in Suruga Province ( present-day Shimizu Ward , Shimizu City , Shizuoka Prefecture ) and Hayakawajiri in Sagami Province ( present-day Odawara City , Kanagawa Prefecture ) . Takauji captured Tadayoshi and confined him in Kamakura .\\nTadayoshi died suddenly in February , 1352 .\\n\" Taiheiki \" says that Tadayoshi might have been poisoned by Takauji .\\nSoon after Tadayoshi \\'s death , being attacked by the Southern Court forces represented by Prince Muneyoshi , Yoshioki NITTA , Yoshimune NITTA and Tokiyuki HOJO , Takauji retreated to Musashi Province , but soon returned to Kyoto to defeat the Southern forces .\\nAfter that Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA intruded in Kyoto , but eventually he left for Kyushu .\\nIn 1354 , Kyoto was retaken by the Southern Court temporarily , but taken back by Takauji the following year .\\nHe plotted to kill Tadafuyu , but died of a tumor on his back at the palace of Made \\'nokoji in Nijo , Kyoto , on April 30th , 1358 .\\nHis age at death : 54 .\\nAccording to \" Baishoron , \" Takauji regretted having turned against Emperor Go-Daigo , and he for a while he was talking about becoming a priest . In the heat of battle he also talked about killing himself , so Shin \\'ichi SATO took these descriptions into consideration , and presumed that Takauji might have been a manic depressive .\\nTakauji \\'s close friend Soseki MUSO described Takauji as a man of virtue in his writing .\\nTakauji was willing to allot lands to his military commanders , which is considered one of the reasons why he was always supported by them when he was in difficult situations .\\nIt was the Mitogaku originated by Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA that started to consider Takauji as a traitor in the Edo period .\\nMitogaku was strongly influenced by Shushigaku Meibunron , and emphasized the validity of the Imperial line .\\nBecause of this , Takauji , who exiled the authentic emperor ( Go-Daigo ) , was described in a negative way as a traitor .\\nMitogaku \\'s view of Takauji was inherited by the later generations , and in the late Tokugawa period when Sonno-Joi ( Revere the Emperor , Expel the Barbarian ) culminated , the heads of wooden statues of Takauji , Yoshiakira and Yoshimitsu ( ASHIKAGA ) in Toji-in were pilloried .\\nAfter the Meiji period , the Meiji government sought to establish a nation-state which set the emperor in the center of the nation . This produced a nationalistic view of history , which justified Taisei Hokan and Osei Fukko , and so the Taika Reforms , Kenmu no Chuko ( = Kenmu restoration ) and Meiji Restoration were ranked as the most important reforms .\\nUntil mid Meiji period , source-based study of modern history did not emphasize the validity of Emperor Go-Daigo ( the Southern Court ) , but at around 1907 40 when the Nanbokucho Seijunron arose , the validity of Emperor Go-Daigo came to be stressed , creating a negative evaluation of Takauji .\\nAccording to an authorized textbook written before WWII , Takauji was \" a traitor who released an arrow against the Emperor \" , and Kumakichi NAKAJIMA , a member of the Makoto SAITO Cabinet , was forced to retire because he had praised Takauji in his writing .\\nAfter WWII , the nationalistic view of history became obsolete , and the source-based study of history made progress on reevaluating Takauji .\\nSato \\'s interpretation of Takauji as a ruler in the lord-and-vassal relationship was one example , which afforded an opportunity to develop a study of the samurai government .\\nIn today \\'s historical study , nobody interprets Takauji as a traitor any more , and the process of Takauji \\'s becoming a traitor sometimes can be a theme of historical study .\\n\" Shihon Taiheiki \" written by Eiji YOSHIKAWA in the late 1950s had Takauji as a main character , and was accepted by many readers , which suggested that not only the political but also the cultural view of Takauji had shifted very much compared with that before WWII .\\n\" Kibamusha zo \" ( a portrait of warrior on the horse back ) , preserved in the Kyoto National Museum , was generally known as a portrait of Takauji , but is now considered to be a portrait of KO no Moronao , the regent of the Ashikaga clan , or that of KO no Moroakira , son of Moronao .

"'臨済宗（臨濟宗、りんざいしゅう）は、中国禅五家七宗（ごけしちしゅう）（臨済、潙仰宗、曹洞宗、雲門宗、法眼宗）のひとつで、唐の臨済義玄（？-867年）を宗祖とする。\\n彼は『喝の臨済』『臨済将軍』の異名で知られ、豪放な家風を特徴として中国禅興隆の頂点を極めた。\\n公案に参究することにより見性しようとする看話禅（かんなぜん）で、ただ座禅する曹洞宗の黙照禅とはこの点が異なる。\\n中国における臨済宗\\n臨済宗は、その名の通り、会昌の廃仏後、唐末の宗祖臨済義玄に始まる。\\n臨済は黄檗希運の弟子であり、河北省の地を拠点とし、新興の藩鎮勢力であった成徳府藩鎮の王常侍を支持基盤として宗勢を伸張したが、唐末五代の混乱した時期には、河北は5王朝を中心に混乱した地域であったため、宗勢が振るわなくなる。\\nこの時期の中心人物は、風穴延昭である。\\n臨済宗が再び活気に満ち溢れるようになるのは、北宋代であり、石霜楚円の門下より、ともに江西省を出自とする、黄龍慧南と楊岐方会という、臨済宗の主流となる2派（黄龍派・楊岐派）を生む傑僧が出て、中国全土を席巻することとなった。\\n南宋代になると、楊岐派に属する圜悟克勤の弟子の大慧宗杲が、浙江省を拠点として大慧派を形成し、臨済宗の中の主流派となった。\\n日本における臨済宗\\n宗門では、ゴータマ・シッダッタの教え（悟り）を直接に受け継いだ十大弟子（迦葉）から28代目のボーディダルマ（菩提達磨）を得てインドから中国に伝えられた、ということになっている。\\nその後、禅宗の最高峰を極めた臨済宗は、南宋時代の中国に渡り学んだ栄西らによって、鎌倉時代に日本に伝えられている。\\n日本の臨済宗は、日本の禅の宗派のひとつである。\\n師から弟子への悟りの伝達（法嗣、はっす）を重んじる。\\n釈迦を本師釈迦如来大和尚と、ボーディダルマを初祖菩提達磨大師、臨済を宗祖臨済大師と呼ぶ。\\n同じ禅宗の曹洞宗が地方豪族や一般民衆に広まったのに対し、臨済宗は時の武家政権に支持され、政治・文化に重んじられた。\\nその後時代を下り、江戸時代に白隠禅師によって臨済宗が再建されたため、現在の臨済禅は白隠禅ともいわれている。\\n伝統\\n法嗣という師匠から弟子へと悟りの伝達が続き現在に至る。\\n師匠と弟子の重要なやりとりは、室内の秘密と呼ばれ師匠の部屋の中から持ち出されて公開されることはない。\\n師匠と弟子のやりとりや、師匠の振舞を記録した禅語録から、抜き出したものが公案（判例）とよばれ、宋代からさまざまな集成が編まれてきたが、悟りは言葉では伝えられるものではなく、現代人の文章理解で読もうとすると公案自体が拒絶する。\\nしかし、悟りに導くヒントになることがらの記録であり、禅の典籍はその創立時から現在に至るまで非常に多い。\\nそれとともに宋代以降、禅宗は看話禅（かんなぜん）という、禅語録を教材に老師が提要を講義する（提唱という）スタイルに変わり、臨済を初めとする唐代の祖師たちの威容は見られなくなった。\\n師匠が肉体を去るときには少なくとも跡継ぎを選んで行くが、跡継ぎは必ずしも悟りを開いているとは限らず、その事は師匠とその弟子だけが知っている。\\n新しい師匠が悟りを開いていなくとも、悟りを開いていた師匠の時代から数世代の間であれば、世代を越えて弟子が悟りを開くことは可能なため、その様な手段が取られる。\\n師匠は、ひとりだけではなく複数の師匠を残して行くこともあれば、師匠の判断で跡を嗣ぐ師匠を残さずにその流れが終わることもある。\\nいくつもの支流に分かれ、ある流れは消えて行き、その流れのいくつかが7世紀から現在まで伝わっている。\\n悟り\\n一般に禅宗は知識ではなく、悟りを重んじる。\\n禅宗における悟りとは、生きるもの全てが本来持っている本性である仏性に気付くことを言う。\\nこのため、唐代の祖師たちは苦闘を重ねながら悟ってきたのである。\\nしかし宋代以降、悟りを得るための多くの技法が考案されてきた。\\n坐禅（瞑想とは異なる）、公案（知的な理解を超えた話を理解すること）、読経（お教を読むこと）、作務（普段の作業）などの修行を既に悟りを得た禅師の元ですることで、悟りが得られるようにメソッド化されてきた。\\n悟りは、ロウソクの火が、消えているロウソクに伝わるように（伝灯）、師から弟子へと伝わるとされる。\\nそれは言葉（ロゴス）による伝達ではない。\\nそれゆえに正しい禅師を選ぶことが肝心とされる。\\nそれは悟りを得ている事だけではなく、自分の個性に適合している禅師を選ぶという意味もある。\\nしかしながら、悟りを得た禅師が指導して悟らせるのではない。\\n師を持たずに悟りを得たゴータマ・シッダッタ（仏陀、釈尊）を持ち出すまでもなく、唐代の祖師たちは、師匠から教わって悟ったのではないのである。\\n悟りを言葉により定義することは出来ないが、言葉を始めとしていろいろな方法で悟りの境地を表現することはできる。\\nそのため特に日本に伝わった後、詩や絵画を始めとした芸術的な表現の上に悟りが表現されており、その香りを味わうことができる。\\n芸術以外にも、茶道や華道を始めとした振舞いなどにも表現されており、振舞いをたどることによって、悟りの世界を味わうという手段も生まれている。\\nそれは知的な理解ではない。\\n公案体系\\n宋代以降公案体系がまとめられ、擬似的かもしれないが更に多くの悟りを起こすことを可能にした。\\n公案とは、主に師と弟子の間の会話で構成され、弟子が悟りを得る瞬間の事実を伝える話が多い。\\nまた公案とは論理的、知的な理解を受け付ける事が出来ない、論理を超えた話であり、考えることではなく、公案になり切ることを通してのみ知ることができる。\\nこれらの公案を弟子を導く手順としてまとめたのが公案体系であり、500から1900の公案により構成される。\\n公案体系は師の家風によって異なる。\\n初期に与えられる公案の例：\\n「犬に仏性はありますか?」「無（む）」\\nこの背景には、仏教では誰でも知っている「全ての生き物は仏性を持っている」という知識がある。\\n「片手の拍手の音」\\n弟子は片手でする拍手の音を聞いてそれを師匠に示さなければならない。\\n知的な理解では片手では拍手はできず音はしない。\\n宗派\\n建仁寺派\\n1202年（建仁2年）、中国・南宋に渡って帰国した栄西により始まる。\\n栄西は最初に禅の伝統を日本に伝えた。\\n大本山は、京都の建仁寺。\\n建仁寺は日本最古の禅寺である。\\n東福寺派\\n1236年、宋に渡り帰国した円爾（弁円）により京都で始まる。\\n本山は、京都の東福寺。\\n戦国時代、毛利家の外交僧として活躍した安国寺恵瓊はこの宗派。\\n建長寺派\\n1253年、鎌倉幕府五代執権・北条時頼が中国・南宋から招いた蘭渓道隆により始まる。\\n本山は、蘭渓道隆が開山した鎌倉の建長寺。\\n建長寺は日本で初めて純粋な禅の道場が開かれた日本で最初の禅寺で、一時は1000人以上の禅僧が修行をしていた。\\n円覚寺派\\n1282年中国から招かれた無学祖元により鎌倉で始まる。\\n本山は、鎌倉の円覚寺。\\n円覚寺は、無学祖元から高峰顕日・夢窓疎石へと受け継がれ日本の禅の中心となった時期もある。\\n明治以降の有名な禅師は、今北洪川・釈宗演・朝比奈宗源。\\n禅を西洋に紹介した鈴木大拙は今北と釈宗演の両師の元に在家の居士として参禅した。\\nまた夏目漱石も釈宗演に参じており、その経験は「門」に描かれている。\\n南禅寺派\\n1291年、無関普門により始まる。\\n本山は、京都の南禅寺。\\n国泰寺派\\n1300年頃、慈雲妙意により始まる。\\n総本山は、明治時代に山岡鉄舟の尽力で再興した富山県高岡市にある国泰寺(高岡市)。\\n鉄舟開基の谷中の全生庵も国泰寺派の名刹である。\\n大徳寺派\\n1315年、宗峰妙超により始まる。\\n本山は、京都の大徳寺。\\n室町時代には応仁の乱で荒廃したが、一休宗純が復興した。\\n向嶽寺派\\n1327年、抜隊得勝により始まる。\\n本山は、山梨県甲州市の向嶽寺。\\n妙心寺派\\n1337年、関山慧玄により始まる。\\n本山は、京都の妙心寺。\\n塔頭寺院には、桂春院・春光院・退蔵院などがある。\\n末寺3,400余ヵ寺を持つ臨済宗最大の宗派。\\n天龍寺派\\n1339年、夢窓疎石により始まる。\\n本山は、京都嵐山の天龍寺。\\n永源寺派\\n1361年寂室元光により始まる。\\n本山は、滋賀県東近江市にある永源寺(東近江市)。\\n末寺は、滋賀県を中心に約150ヶ寺。\\n明治13年（1880年）までは東福寺派に属した。\\n方広寺派\\n1384年、無文元選により始まる。\\n本山は、浜松市北区引佐町の方広寺(浜松市)。\\n末寺は、静岡県を中心に約170ヶ寺。\\n明治37年（1904年）までは南禅寺派に属した。\\n相国寺派\\n1392年、夢窓疎石により始まる。\\n本山は、足利義満により建立された京都の相国寺。\\n末寺は、全国に約100ヶ寺。\\n金閣寺・銀閣寺が属する。\\n佛通寺派\\n1397年、愚中周及により始まる。\\n本山は、広島県三原市の佛通寺\\n末寺は、広島県内を中心に約50ヶ寺。\\n明治38年（1905年）までは天竜寺派に属した。\\n関係教育機関\\n花園大学\\n正眼短期大学\\n花園中学校・高等学校\\n伏見城（ふしみじょう）は、現在の京都市伏見区にあった城。\\n「伏見桃山城」は史実にはない近代建築である（本文で詳述）。\\n伏見城は豊臣秀吉によって、自身の隠居後の居所として造られたものが初めである。\\n歴代3度にわたって築城され、初めに指月山に造られたものを指月山伏見城、震災後に木幡山に移されたものを木幡山伏見城などと区別される。\\nさらに、木幡山伏見城は創建時である豊臣期と、関ヶ原の戦災後に再建された徳川期のものに分けられる。\\n秀吉の死後、その遺言によって豊臣秀頼は大阪城に移り、五大老筆頭の徳川家康が代わってこの城に入り政務をとった。\\n関ヶ原の戦いの際、家康の家臣鳥居元忠らが守っていたが、石田方に攻められ焼失している（伏見城の戦い）。\\n後に、家康によって再建され、廃城後はその建造物及び部材が各地に移築されている。\\n廃城後、城郭の一帯は桃畑として開墾されたため桃山と呼ばれた。\\n伏見城を通称桃山城というのはこのためである（織田・豊臣政権期の時代区分「安土桃山時代」や、その文化「桃山文化」などの呼称はこの通称から取られたもの）。\\nまた、開墾にたずさわった一族の末裔は、吉村酒造蔵元の吉村家と伝えられているによると、伏見城跡に設けた堀内村の庄屋を代々務め、明治時代に同村の土地を皇室へ寄進したとの記述がある。\\n史実には直接の関係はない。\\n徳川期の天守は二条城に移築されたため史料が比較的残っているが、それ以前の天守については不明な部分が多い。\\n詳細は不明である。\\n1592年-豊臣秀吉が隠居所として宇治川沿いの低地丘陵である指月山に、後に破却した聚楽第の建物の一部を移築するなどして築城された（指月城）。\\n1596年-地震で倒壊したため、約500m離れた木幡山（現在の桃山）に新たに築城し直された（木幡山城）。\\n1598年-豊臣秀吉がこの城で死去する。\\n1600年-伏見城の戦いで焼失。\\n1601年-徳川家康により再建される。\\n1603年-「征夷大将軍宣下の儀式」に使用。\\n大坂の役の後、伏見城の役割は大坂城へ移り、江戸幕府にとってこの城の重要性は薄れたため、徳川家康の隠居後の1625年に廃城となった。\\n1964年-伏見城花畑跡に遊園地「伏見桃山城キャッスルランド」が建設され、その目玉として模擬天守「伏見桃山城」が建設された。\\n2003年1月-伏見桃山城キャッスルランドが、経営母体である近畿日本鉄道のリストラの一環として閉園。\\n伏見桃山城は京都市民の運動によって伏見のシンボルとして保存されることとなり取り壊しを免れた。\\n現在は公園として整備されている。\\n京都市が無償で譲り受けたが老朽化で内部非公開となっている。\\n2007年10月-時代劇映画「茶々天涯の貴妃」撮影のため、望楼の下に虎の装飾や鯱を金色に塗り替えるなど大坂城に見立てて改装。\\n約１億円の改修費は東映が負担し大坂城としての改修は年内継続。\\n廃城に際して天守を始め多くの建物が他の場所に移築された。\\n有名なものでは二条城や常寂光寺などがあり、福山城(備後国)には、櫓、城門、殿舎、湯殿、多聞櫓、土塀など特に多くの施設が移されている。\\n移築の伝承を持ち現存する主な施設を以下に挙げる。\\nなお、この内、移築が裏付けられているのは指月山の遺構である西教寺客殿と徳川期の遺構である福山城伏見櫓のみであることに留意されたい。\\n石垣\\n淀城（伏見区）\\n大阪城（大阪府大阪市）\\n城門\\n御香宮神社（伏見区）表門（大手門を移築）\\n西本願寺（下京区）唐門\\n二尊院（右京区）総門\\n観音寺（上京区）山門\\n瑞宝寺公園（兵庫県神戸市）\\n浄照寺(奈良県磯城郡田原本町)表門（伏見城高麗門を移築)\\n櫓\\n福山城（広島県福山市）伏見櫓（重要文化財）\\n殿舎\\n大通寺(長浜市)（滋賀県長浜市）本堂（重文）\\n日暮御殿-都久夫須麻神社（滋賀県長浜市・竹生島）本殿（国宝）\\nその他\\n諸侯控え室-三渓園（横浜市中区(横浜市)）\\n移動式能舞台-福山城（広島県福山市）、現在は沼名前神社（広島県福山市・鞆の浦）（重文）\\n茶室-高台寺（東山区）時雨亭、傘亭（ともに重文）\\n軍議評定所-渡辺山守綱寺（愛知県豊田市）本堂\\n伏見御殿の襖絵-福山城（広島県福山市）\\n狩野派（かのうは）は、日本絵画史上最大の画派であり、室町時代中期（15世紀）から江戸時代末期（19世紀）まで、約400年にわたって活動し、常に画壇の中心にあった専門画家集団である。\\n室町幕府の御用絵師となった狩野正信を始祖とし、その子孫は、室町幕府崩壊後は織田信長、豊臣秀吉、徳川将軍などに絵師として仕え、その時々の権力者と結び付いて常に画壇の中心を占め、内裏、城郭、大寺院などの障壁画から扇面などの小画面に至るまで、あらゆるジャンルの絵画を手掛ける職業画家集団として、日本美術界に多大な影響を及ぼした。\\n狩野派は、親・兄弟などの血族関係を主軸とした画家集団で、約4世紀間の長期にわたって一国の画壇に君臨したという点で、世界的にも他にほとんど例を見ないものである。\\n狩野派の代表的な絵師としては、室町幕府8代将軍足利義政に仕えた初代狩野正信とその嫡男・狩野元信、元信の孫で安土城や大坂城の障壁画を制作した狩野永徳、永徳の孫で京都から江戸に本拠を移し、江戸城、二条城などの障壁画制作を指揮した狩野探幽、京都にとどまって「京狩野」と称された一派を代表する狩野山楽などが挙げられる。\\n江戸幕府の体制が安定して以後の狩野派は、幕府の御用絵師として、内裏、城郭などの障壁画の大量注文をこなす必要に迫られた。\\n膨大な量の障壁画の注文に応えるため、狩野家の当主は、一門の絵師たちを率いて集団で制作にあたる必要があった。\\nそのため、狩野派の絵師には、絵師個人の個性の表出ではなく、先祖伝来の粉本（絵手本）や筆法を忠実に学ぶことが求められた。\\nこうした時代背景から、狩野探幽以降の狩野派は伝統の維持と御用絵師としての勢力保持にもっぱら努め、芸術的創造性を失っていったという見方もある。\\n芸術家の個性の表現や内面の表出を尊重する現代において、狩野派の絵画への評価は必ずしも高いとは言えない。\\nしかしながら、狩野派が約4世紀にわたって日本の画壇をリードし、そこから多くの画家が育っていったことも事実であり、良きにつけ悪しきにつけ、狩野派を抜きにして日本の絵画史を語ることはできない。\\n近世以降の日本の画家の多くが狩野派の影響を受け、狩野派の影響から出発したことも事実であり、琳派の尾形光琳、写生派の円山応挙なども初期には狩野派に学んでいる。\\n狩野派の祖は室町幕府の御用絵師として活動した狩野正信（1434?-1530）である。\\n彼は当時の日本人としては長寿を保ち（通説では97歳で没）、15世紀半ばから16世紀前半まで活動した。\\n正信の出自は伊豆方面とされているが定かではない。\\n20世紀後半以降の研究の進展により、狩野家は下野国足利（栃木県足利市）の長尾氏と何らかの関係があったものと推定されており、足利市の長林寺に残る墨画の『観瀑図』は正信の比較的初期の作品と考えられている。\\n正信の画業として記録に残る最初の事例は、応仁の乱（1467-1477）の直前の寛正4年（1463年）、30歳の時に京都の雲頂院（相国寺塔頭）に観音と羅漢図の壁画を制作したというもので（『蔭涼軒日録』所載）、この時点で正信がすでに京都において画家として活動していたことがわかる。\\n正信が壁画を描いた雲頂院の本寺である相国寺は室町幕府3代将軍足利義満創建の禅寺で、如拙、周文、雪舟らの画僧を輩出した室町画壇の中心的存在であり、この当時は周文の弟子にあたる画僧・宗湛（小栗宗湛、1413-1481）が御用絵師として活動していた。\\n狩野正信がいつ上京し、誰に師事し、いつ室町幕府の御用絵師となったか、正確なところは不明であるが、室町幕府8代将軍・足利義政に重用されていたことは諸記録から明らかである。\\n10年にわたった応仁の乱（1467-1477）終結の数年後の文明(日本)13年（1481年）、室町幕府の御用絵師であった宗湛が死去しており、狩野正信は、宗湛の跡を継いで幕府の御用絵師に任命されたものと思われる。\\nこれ以後は、宮廷の絵所預（えどころあずかり）の職にあった大和絵系の土佐光信と、漢画系の狩野正信の両者が画壇の二大勢力となった。\\n文明14年（1482年）、前将軍・足利義政は、東山殿（銀閣寺の前身）の造営を始め、正信がその障壁画を担当することとなった。\\n延徳2年（1490年）の義政の没後、正信は当時政治の実権を握っていた細川氏に仕えるようになる。\\n正信はこのように、時の権力者との結び付きを深めつつ画壇での地位を固め、後の狩野派隆盛の基礎を築いた。\\n記録によれば、正信は障壁画、仏画を含め、多様な形式・題材の作品を手掛けたことが知られるが、障壁画はことごとく失われ、現存する確実な作品は掛軸などの小画面に限られている。\\nその画風は、同時代人の土佐光信の伝統的な大和絵風とは対照的に、水墨を基調とし、中国宋・元の画法を元にした「漢画」であった。\\n正信は97歳の長寿を保ったが、晩年の約30年間の事績は明らかでなく、嫡男の元信に画業を継がせて引退生活を送っていた模様である。\\n狩野派隆盛の基盤を築いた、2代目・狩野元信（1476-1559）は正信の嫡男で、文明8年（1476年）に生まれた。\\n現存する代表作は大徳寺大仙院方丈の障壁画（方丈は永正10年（1513年）に完成）、天文(元号)12年（1543年）の妙心寺霊雲院障壁画などである（大仙院障壁画については、方丈竣工時の作品ではなく、やや後の年代の作とする見方が有力である）。\\n大仙院方丈障壁画は相阿弥、元信と弟・狩野之信が部屋ごとに制作を分担しており、元信が担当したのは「檀那の間」の『四季花鳥図』と、「衣鉢の間」の『禅宗祖師図』などであった。\\nこのうち、『禅宗祖師図』は典型的な水墨画であるが、『四季花鳥図』は水墨を基調としつつ、草花や鳥の部分にのみ濃彩を用いて新しい感覚を示している。\\n元信は時の権力者であった足利将軍や細川家との結び付きを強め、多くの門弟を抱えて、画家集団としての狩野派の基盤を確かなものにした。\\n武家だけでなく、公家、寺社などからの注文にも応え、寺社関係では、大坂にあった石山本願寺の障壁画を元信が手掛けたことが記録から分かっているが、これは現存しない。\\n元信は晩年には「越前守」を名乗り、また「法眼（ほうげん）」という僧位を与えられたことから、後世には「古法眼」「越前法眼」などと称されている。\\n作品のレパートリーは幅広く、障壁画のほか、寺社の縁起絵巻、絵馬、大和絵風の金屏風、肖像画なども手掛けている。\\n元信は父正信の得意とした漢画、水墨画に大和絵の画法を取り入れ、襖、屏風などの装飾的な大画面を得意とし、狩野派様式の基礎を築いた。\\nまた、書道の楷書、行書、草書にならって、絵画における「真体、行体、草体」という画体の概念を確立し、近世障壁画の祖とも言われている。\\n元信には宗信、秀頼、直信の3人の男子があったが、長男の宗信は早世したため、宗家を継いだのは三男の直信（1519-1592）であった。\\nなぜ二男の秀頼でなく三男の直信に家督を継がせたのかは定かでない。\\n直信は、道名の狩野松栄の名で広く知られ、室町から桃山に至る時代に活動した。\\n代表作としては、大徳寺に残る巨大な『涅槃図』（縦約6m）がある。\\nまた、父・元信とともに石山本願寺障壁画制作に参加しており、大徳寺聚光院（じゅこういん）障壁画制作には息子の永徳とともに参加しているが、父・元信と息子・永徳がそれぞれに高名であるために、やや地味な存在となっている。\\n松栄の嫡男・狩野永徳（1543-1590）は州信（くにのぶ）とも称し、桃山時代の日本画壇を代表する人物である。\\n織田信長、豊臣秀吉といった乱世を生き抜いた権力者の意向に敏感に応え、多くの障壁画を描いたが、これら障壁画は建物とともに消滅し、現存する永徳の作品は比較的少ない。\\n現存する代表作の一つである大徳寺聚光院方丈障壁画は永徳と父・松栄の分担制作であるが、父・松栄は方丈南側正面の主要な部屋の襖絵を息子の永徳にまかせ、自分は脇役に回っている。\\n封建社会の当時にあっては、家門の長が主要な部屋の襖絵を描くのが常識であり、この障壁画制作時には松栄は才能豊かな永徳に家督を譲って、自身はすでに隠居の身であったと考証されている。\\n聚光院方丈障壁画のうち、室中（しっちゅう、方丈正面中央の部屋）を飾る『花鳥図』は特に評価が高い。\\nその後、永徳は天正4-7年（1576-1579年）、織田信長が建立した安土城天守の障壁画制作に携わった。\\n信長亡き後は豊臣秀吉の大坂城や聚楽第の障壁画を制作し、晩年には内裏の障壁画制作にも携わった。\\nこれらの作品群は、当時の日記や記録類にその斬新さを高く評価されており、現存していれば永徳の代表作となったであろうが、建物とともに障壁画も消滅してしまった。\\n現存する永徳の代表作としては、前述の聚光院方丈障壁画のほか、旧御物の『唐獅子図屏風』、上杉氏伝来の『洛中洛外図屏風』が名高く、東京国立博物館の『檜図屏風』も古来永徳筆と伝えるものである。\\n永徳は細画（さいが）と大画（たいが）のいずれをも得意としたが、大量の障壁画の注文をこなすために、大画様式で描かざるをえなかったという。\\n細画とは細部まで細かく描き込んだ絵、大画は豪放な作風の絵と解釈されている。\\n近世初期の狩野派には他にも重要な画家が多い。\\n国宝の『高雄観楓図』には「秀頼」の印があり、古来、狩野元信の次男・狩野秀頼（生没年未詳）の作とされているが、『高雄観楓図』の筆者の「秀頼」は別人で、元信の孫にあたる真笑秀頼という絵師だとも言われている。\\n狩野宗秀（そうしゅう、1551-1601）は元秀（もとひで）とも称し永徳の弟で、安土城障壁画制作などで永徳の助手として働いた。\\n屏風、肖像画などの現存作がある。\\nやはり永徳の弟である狩野長信（1577-1654）は『花下遊楽図』（国宝）の筆者として名高い。\\n狩野家直系以外の絵師としては、川越・喜多院の『職人尽図屏風』の筆者である狩野吉信（1552-1640）、京都・豊国神社(京都市)の『豊国祭図屏風』の筆者である狩野内膳（1570-1616）らが知られる。\\n狩野永徳は父の松栄（直信）に先立って48歳で没した。\\nその後を継いだのは永徳の長男・狩野光信（1565?-1608）と次男・狩野孝信（1571-1618）である。\\n光信は、園城寺勧学院客殿障壁画などを残し、永徳とは対照的な、大和絵風の繊細な画風を特色とした。\\nこうした画風が制作当時の一般的な好みに合致しなかったためか、『本朝画史』などの近世の画論は一様に光信を低く評価している。\\n狩野家の頭領である光信が死去した時、その子の狩野貞信（1597-1623）はまだ12歳の若年であったので、光信の弟である孝信が狩野派を率いることとなった。\\n封建制度の下では、光信の長男である貞信の家系が宗家となるはずであったが、貞信が27歳で早世し後継ぎがなかったため、以後、幕末に至る狩野家の正系は孝信の子孫となっている。\\n孝信には守信（探幽、1602-1674）、狩野尚信（1607-1650）、狩野安信（1613-1685）の3人の男子があり、この3人はそれぞれ鍛冶橋狩野家、木挽町（こびきちょう）狩野家、中橋狩野家（宗家）の祖となった。\\n末弟の安信は前述の貞信の養子という扱いで狩野の宗家を継ぐことになったが、絵師として最も名高いのは探幽こと守信である。\\n守信は、後に出家して探幽斎と称し、画家としては狩野探幽の名で知られる。\\n後に江戸に本拠を移し、江戸幕府の御用絵師として、画壇における狩野派の地位をますます不動のものとした。\\n探幽は幼少時より画才を発揮し、慶長17年（1612年）、11歳の時に駿府で徳川家康に対面、元和(日本)7年（1621年）には江戸鍛冶橋門外に屋敷を得て、以後江戸を拠点に活動し、城郭や大寺院などの障壁画を精力的に制作した。\\n探幽の作品のうち、江戸城と大坂城の障壁画は建物とともに消滅したが、名古屋城上洛殿の障壁画（水墨）は第二次大戦時には建物から取り外して疎開させてあったため空襲をまぬがれて現存しており、他に二条城二の丸御殿や大徳寺方丈の障壁画が現存する代表作である。\\nこれら大画面のほかにも、掛軸、絵巻、屏風などあらゆるジャンルの作品を残している。\\n二条城二の丸御殿障壁画は25歳の若描きで、永徳風の豪壮な画風を示すが、後年の大徳寺の障壁画は水墨を主体とし、余白をたっぷりと取った穏やかな画風のものである。\\n絵巻や屏風には大和絵風の作品もある。\\n探幽は写生（スケッチ）や古画の模写を重視し、写生図集や模写画集を多数残している。\\n「探幽縮図」と称される探幽筆の古画模写は多数現存しており、各地の美術館や収集家が所蔵しているが、これらには今日では原画が失われてしまった古画の模写も多数含まれており、日本絵画史研究上、貴重な資料となっている。\\n江戸時代の狩野派は、狩野家の宗家を中心とした血族集団と、全国にいる多数の門人からなる巨大な画家集団であり、ピラミッド型の組織を形成していた。\\n「奥絵師」と呼ばれる、もっとも格式の高い4家を筆頭に、それに次いで格式の高い「表絵師」が約15家あり、その下には公儀や寺社の画事ではなく、一般町人の需要に応える「町狩野」が位置するというように、明確に格付けがされ、その影響力は日本全国に及んでいた。\\nこの時代の権力者は封建社会の安定継続を望み、江戸城のような公の場に描かれる絵画は、新奇なものより伝統的な粉本に則って描かれたものが良しとされた。\\nまた、大量の障壁画制作をこなすには、弟子一門を率いて集団で制作する必要があり、集団制作を容易にするためにも絵師個人の個性よりも粉本（絵手本）を学習することが重視された。\\nこうした点から、狩野派の絵画は、個性や新味に乏しいものになっていったことは否めない。\\n奥絵師は旗本と同格で、将軍への「お目見え」と帯刀が許されたというから、その格式の高さがうかがえる。\\n奥絵師の4家とは探幽（狩野孝信の長男）の系統の鍛冶橋家、尚信（孝信の次男）の系統の木挽町家（当初は「竹川町家」）、安信（孝信の三男）の系統の中橋家、それに狩野岑信（みねのぶ、1662-1708）の系統の浜町家である（岑信は、狩野尚信の長男である狩野常信の次男）。\\n探幽には初め実子がなかったため、刀剣金工家の後藤立乗の息子の洞雲（狩野益信、1625-1694）を養子とした。\\n後に探幽が50歳を過ぎて生まれた実子である狩野守政（1653-1718）が跡を継ぐが、この系統からはその後見るべき画家は出なかった。\\n探幽には多くの弟子がいたが、中では『夕顔棚納涼図』を残した久隅守景（くすみもりかげ、生没年未詳）が著名である。\\n守景は何らかの事情で狩野派を破門になり、後には金沢方面で制作したが、経歴について不明な点が多い。\\n前述のとおり、狩野家の宗家は、探幽の弟・安信の中橋家が継ぐことになった。\\n安信の子の狩野時信（1642-1678）は30代で没し、その子の狩野主信（うじのぶ、1675-1724）が家督を継ぐが、この系統からもその後目立った画人は出ていない。\\n都会的な画風で人気を博した英一蝶（はなぶさいっちょう、1652-1724）は安信の弟子であった。\\n奥絵師4家の中で、幕末まで比較的高名な画人を輩出したのは、尚信の系統の木挽町家である。\\nこの家系からは尚信の嫡男の狩野常信（1636-1713）、その子の狩野周信（ちかのぶ、1660-1728）と狩野岑信（みねのぶ、1662-1708）らが出ている。\\n岑信は将軍・徳川家宣の寵愛を受け、後に「浜町家」として独立し、「奥絵師家」の1つに数えられるようになった。\\nこのほか、狩野興以（?-1636）は狩野家の血族ではないが、探幽ら3兄弟の師匠筋にあたる人物で、その功績によって狩野姓を与えられ、後に紀州徳川家に仕えている。\\n一方、京都に残って活動を続けた「京狩野」という一派もあり、狩野永徳の弟子であった狩野山楽（1559-1635）がその中心人物である。\\n山楽は豊臣秀吉の家臣であった近江の木村家の出で、元の名を木村光頼と言った。\\n京都・大覚寺宸殿の障壁画『牡丹図』『紅白梅図』が代表作で、金地に色彩豊かで装飾的な画面を展開している。\\n山楽の娘婿で養子の狩野山雪（1589/90-1651）は、妙心寺天球院障壁画のほか、屏風絵などの現存作がある。\\n樹木、岩などの独特の形態、徹底した細部描写など、狩野派の絵師の中では異色の個性的な画風をもつ。\\n山雪の残した画論を、子の狩野永納（1631-1697）がまとめたものが、日本人による本格的な絵画史としては最初のものとされる『本朝画史』である。\\n木挽町家からは、江戸時代後期に狩野典信（えいせんいんみちのぶ、1730-1790）、狩野惟信（ようせんいんこれのぶ、1753-1808）、狩野栄信（いせんいんながのぶ、1775-1828）、狩野養信（せいせんいんおさのぶ、1786-1846）などが出ている。\\n晴川院養信は、天保9年（1838年）と同15年（1844年）に相次いで焼失した江戸城の西の丸および本丸御殿の再建に際し、膨大な障壁画の制作を狩野派の棟梁として指揮した。\\n障壁画そのものは現存しないが、膨大な下絵が東京国立博物館に所蔵されている。\\n晴川院は古画の模写や収集にも尽力した。\\n一般に、江戸時代後期の狩野派絵師に対する評価はあまり高くないが、20世紀後半以降の研究の進展により、晴川院は古典絵画から幕末の新しい絵画の動きまで熱心に研究した、高い技術をもった絵師であったことが認識されるようになり、再評価の動きがある。\\n晴川院の次代の狩野雅信（しょうせんいんただのぶ、1823-1880）の門下には、明治初期の日本画壇の重鎮となった狩野芳崖（下関出身、1828-1888）と橋本雅邦（川越出身、1835-1908）がいた。\\n芳崖と雅邦はともに地方の狩野派系絵師の家の出身であった。\\n職業絵師集団としての狩野派は、パトロンであった江戸幕府の終焉とともにその歴史的役目を終えた。\\n基礎情報天皇\\n白河天皇（しらかわてんのう、天喜元年6月19日(旧暦)（1053年7月7日）-大治4年7月7日(旧暦)（1129年7月24日））は、第72代の天皇。\\n在位は延久4年12月8日(旧暦)（1073年1月18日）-応徳3年11月26日(旧暦)（1087年1月5日）。\\n諱を貞仁（さだひと）という。\\n藤原氏摂家と外戚関係の薄い後三条天皇の第一皇子として生まれ、母は藤原氏閑院流出身で中納言藤原公成の娘、春宮大夫藤原能信の養女である女御藤原茂子（?-1062）。\\n同母妹に篤子内親王（堀河天皇中宮）。\\n系図\\n幼い時は父子ともに冷遇されたが、治暦4年（1068年）、父帝即位とともに親王宣下を受け貞仁親王となる。\\n翌延久元年（1069年）立太子、同4年、20歳で即位。\\n関白を置いたが、翌5年、上皇の病没後も、父同様に親政を目指し、荘園整理などに力を入れ摂関家の権勢を弱めることに努める。\\n後三条院とその生母である陽明門院は白河天皇の異母弟実仁親王(平安時代)更にその弟の輔仁親王に皇位を継がせる意志を持ち、譲位時に実仁親王を皇太弟と定めた。\\n白河天皇はこれに反発したが応徳2年（1085年）実仁親王は病没した。\\nこれにより、応徳3年11月（1086年）、白河天皇は輔仁親王ではなく、8歳のわが子の善仁親王（第73代堀河天皇）を皇太子に立て、即日譲位した。\\n太上天皇となった白河上皇は、幼帝を後見するために白河院として自ら政務を執り、いわゆる院政が出現した。\\n引き続き摂政関白は置かれたものの、これにより名目上の存在に近いものとなる。\\n白河上皇は堀河天皇の成人後も政権を返すことなく、受領階級や武家出身の近臣を用いて専制的な政治を行った。\\n武士は、院の警護役として創設した北面の武士になどにあてた。\\n熱心に仏教を信じ、嘉保3年（1096年）には皇女の病没を機に出家し法名を融観とし、法皇となった。\\nまた法勝寺等の多くの寺院や仏像をつくらせたが、その経済力は受領の経済力を活用した。\\n堀河天皇崩御後は、その皇子で自らの孫である第74代鳥羽天皇、更にその子の第75代崇徳天皇と3代にわたって幼主を擁し、大治4年7月7日（1129年7月24日）、77歳で崩御するまで実に3代43年間院政を敷いた。\\nこれを「治天の君」という。\\n白河法皇が「天下の三不如意―鴨川(淀川水系)（鴨川）の水（鴨川の流れとそれによる水害）・双六の賽（サイコロ、当時の双六（ただし、現在のものと違い西洋のバックギャモンに近い）は賭博の手段として盛んに用いられて、さいころの目の動きが勝敗を分けた）・山法師（比叡山延暦寺の僧衆〔僧兵〕）」だけはどうしようもないと嘆いたという故事は、裏を返せば彼がそれ以外のものであれば思い通りにならない事はないという絶大な権力を誇っていたことを示している。\\nまた、女性関係の派手さでも知られており、崇徳天皇や平清盛が「白河法皇の御落胤」であるという噂が当時広く流布され信じられる原因ともなっている。\\n中宮：藤原賢子（1057-1084）-源顕房女、藤原師実養女\\n敦文親王（1074-1077）\\n媞子内親王（郁芳門院）（1076-1096）-斎宮\\n令子内親王（1078-1144）-斎院\\n善仁親王（堀河天皇）（1079-1107）\\n禛子内親王（土御門斎院）（1081-1156）\\n女御：藤原道子（1042-1132）-藤原能長女\\n善子内親王（六角斎宮）（1076-1

った。\\n水戸学に発する尊氏観はその後も継承され、尊王思想が高まった幕末期には尊皇攘夷論者によって等持院の尊氏・義詮・義満3代の木像が梟首される事件も発生している。\\n明治時代になると、明治政府の立場から天皇を中心とする国民国家を建設するため、国家主義的な歴史観が構築されていったが、それは大政奉還・王政復古を正当化する歴史観であり、そのため大化の改新・建武の中興・明治維新が最も重要な改革に位置づけられた。\\n明治中期までは近代的歴史学による実証的研究から後醍醐天皇・南朝の正統性はそれほど強調されていなかったが、明治40年代に入り、南北朝正閏論を経て、後醍醐天皇・南朝の正統性が強く主張されていき、それに伴って尊氏に対する否定的な評価が確定することとなった。\\n戦前の国定教科書には「天皇に弓を引いた逆臣」と書かれており、斎藤実内閣の中島久万吉商工大臣が尊氏を礼賛した文章を書いたために辞任する事件も起こった。\\n戦後になると、国家主義的な歴史観が大きく後退し実証主義的な歴史研究が進展したことに伴い、尊氏の再評価が進められた。\\n佐藤進一による主従制的支配者としての尊氏の評価はその一例であり、これは武家政権に関する研究が大きく進展する契機となった。\\n現代の歴史研究において、尊氏を逆賊とする見解は存在せず、むしろ尊氏が逆賊となるまでの経過が歴史研究の一テーマになることもある。\\n文化面においても、吉川英治が昭和30年代に書いた『私本太平記』は尊氏を主人公としているが読者に広く受け入れられており、尊氏への評価が戦前のものから大きく変化していることがわかる。\\n京都国立博物館所蔵の『騎馬武者像』は尊氏の肖像として一般に知られていたが、2代将軍足利義詮の花押が像上部に据えられていることや、騎馬武者の馬具に描かれている輪違の紋が足利氏の家紋ではないこと（高氏の家紋が輪違）などの理由から、足利家執事高師直あるいはその子の高師詮の肖像とする説が有力視されており、現在では尊氏説は否定されている。\\n鎌倉時代に藤原隆信が描いたとされる国宝神護寺三像のうち伝平重盛像は、平重盛を描いたものと考えられてきたが、1990年代半ばに美術史家の米倉迪夫や黒田日出男らによって尊氏像であるとの説が提示され、広い支持を集めている。\\n等持院所蔵の尊氏木像との比較や、冠をとめる笄（こうがい）が室町初期に流行した形状であることなどが根拠として挙げられている。\\n広島県尾道市の浄土寺にも尊氏を描いたとされる肖像画が所蔵されている。\\nその他、江戸時代に描かれた錦絵に歌川芳虎の「太平記合戦図」（尊氏、兵庫・福海寺に避難する図）、橋本周延の「足利尊氏兵庫合戦図」（尊氏、兵庫・福海寺に避難する図）がある。\\nまた、現代になって作られた銅像が足利市鑁阿寺参道と京都府綾部市安国寺町に設置されている。\\n父：足利貞氏\\n母：上杉清子\\n弟：足利直義\\n足利尊氏\\n正室：赤橋登子\\n子：足利義詮\\n子：娘\\n子：聖王\\n子：足利基氏\\n子：頼子（崇光天皇皇后）\\n子：了清\\n子：娘\\n側室：加古基氏（法名：雲光院覚遍、足利一族）の女（『尊卑分脈』・『系図纂要』より）\\n子：足利竹若丸\\n側室（越前局?）\\n子：足利直冬\\n側室\\n子：英仲法俊\\n太平記\\n梅松論\\n太平記（森村誠一）\\n私本太平記（吉川英治）\\n新・太平記（山岡荘八）\\n足利尊氏（童門冬二）\\n足利尊氏（村上元三）\\n風の群像（杉本苑子）\\n太平記(NHK大河ドラマ)（1991年日本放送協会大河ドラマ、俳優：雨笠利幸/真田広之、主人公）\\n北条時宗(NHK大河ドラマ)（2001年NHK大河ドラマ、俳優：三觜要介）\\n嵯峨野観光鉄道（さがのかんこうてつどう）は、京都府京都市と亀岡市で山陰本線旧線を利用して嵯峨野観光鉄道嵯峨野観光線にトロッコ列車を運行している会社。\\n西日本旅客鉄道の完全子会社である。\\n本社は京都府京都市右京区嵯峨天竜寺車道町。\\n鉄道の電化・複線化のため、山陰本線（嵯峨野線）の嵯峨（現在の嵯峨嵐山）～馬堀間が、1989年3月に新線に切替えられたが、景勝地として名高い保津峡に沿って走るこの旧線を観光鉄道として活用することになり、1991年からトロッコ列車の運行を開始している。\\nけいてつ協會『しられざる鉄道』ジェイティービー,1997年によると日本初の純粋な観光専用鉄道とされる。\\nこのほか、トロッコ列車の京都側の始発駅であるトロッコ嵯峨駅の駅前には、19世紀の科学技術や芸術を展示している「19thCENTURYHALL」（19世紀ホール）があり、これの運営も行っている。\\n19世紀ホールには、国鉄D51形蒸気機関車などの蒸気機関車なども展示されている。\\n歴史\\n1990年（平成2年）11月4日設立。\\n1991年（平成3年）4月27日嵯峨野観光線トロッコ嵯峨駅～トロッコ亀岡駅間が開業。\\n2002年（平成14年）11月イメージキャラクター「トロッキー」登場。\\n2003年（平成15年）4月トロッコ嵯峨駅前に19世紀ホールがオープン。\\n路線\\n運行形態などは下記を参照。\\n嵯峨野観光鉄道嵯峨野観光線トロッコ嵯峨駅-トロッコ亀岡駅7.3km\\n車両\\n全てJRに在籍していた車両を改造して使用している。\\n機関車は国鉄DE10形ディーゼル機関車1104号機を専用機として塗色変更、予備としてJRに在籍している同1156号機を塗色変更の上使用している。\\n客車は、国鉄トキ25000形貨車からの改造である。\\n京都市交通局（きょうとしこうつうきょく）は、京都府京都市内及びその周辺地域で公営交通事業を行う京都市の地方公営企業の一つである。\\n地下鉄（京都市営地下鉄）、路線バス（京都市営バス）を運営している。\\nかつては市電（京都市電）・トロリーバス（京都市営トロリーバス）も運営していた。\\nスルッとKANSAIでカードに印字される符号は入場記録用は京交で、降車記録用がKCである。\\n事業\\n京都市営地下鉄（2路線31.2km）\\n京都市営バス\\n歴史\\n各事業の詳細な歴史は、京都市営地下鉄、京都市営バス、京都市電、京都市営トロリーバスの各項目を参照。\\n1895年（明治28年）2月1日京都電気鉄道が、日本初の路面電車を塩小路東洞院下ル（現在の京都駅前付近）～伏見下油掛間で開業させる。\\n1912年（明治45年）6月11日京都市電気軌道事務所が市電烏丸線、千本・大宮線、四条線、丸太町線を開業。\\n1918年（大正7年）7月1日京都市が京都電気鉄道を買収。\\n1920年（大正9年）7月7日京都市電気部に改組。\\n1924年（大正13年）4月15日京都市電気局に改組。\\n1928年（昭和3年）5月10日市営バス運行開始。\\n1932年（昭和7年）4月1日トロリーバス運行開始。\\n1947年（昭和22年）12月17日京都市交通局に改組。\\n1969年（昭和44年）10月1日トロリーバス廃止。\\n1978年（昭和53年）10月1日市電全廃。\\n1981年（昭和56年）5月29日京都市営地下鉄烏丸線開業。\\n1983年（昭和58年）3月15日「京都観光一日乗車券」が発売開始。\\n1993年（平成5年）7月1日プリペイドカード「トラフィカ京カード」が発売開始。\\n1997年（平成9年）10月12日京都市営地下鉄東西線開業。\\n2000年（平成12年）3月1日共通乗車カードシステム「スルッとKANSAI」に加入。\\n「スルッとKANSAI都カード」発売。\\n2007年（平成19年）4月1日地下鉄路線でICカード「PiTaPa」を導入（乗り入れしている近畿日本鉄道、京阪電気鉄道大津線も同時導入）。\\n大阪メトロサービスとの提携カードである「京都ぷらすOSAKAPiTaPa」を発行。\\n2008年（平成20年）3月31日京都市交通局本庁舎が、中京区壬生から右京区の太秦天神川「サンサ右京」に移転。\\nキャラクター\\n都くん（地下鉄）\\n京ちゃん（市バス）\\nじゅうじゅう（市バスの内「かわらまち・よるバス」に特化したキャラクター）\\n備考\\n社名に「京都」を冠する路線バス事業者の京阪京都交通（旧・京都交通(亀岡)）、京都交通(舞鶴)、京都バスとは、人材・資本の関係が一切ない。\\n京都市交通局の労働組合は京都交通労働組合（日本都市交通労働組合に加盟）である。\\n京都バスの労働組合は京都バス労働組合、京阪京都交通の労働組合は京阪京バス労働組合（ともに日本私鉄労働組合総連合会に加盟）である。\\n発車メロディ関連では鉄道事業者で唯一、著作権を有している。\\n2007年に京都市幽霊バス問題が発覚。\\n公共広告機構の2007年度地域キャンペーン「天ぷら油で走る」のコマーシャルメッセージに京都市バスが登場した。\\nCMの内容は、1997年に発表された京都議定書に基づき、地球温暖化防止のために軽油に代わる燃料として食用油の廃油で作ったバイオディーゼル燃料を使用し、市バスやゴミ収集車に使用しているというもの。\\nこのCMはAC大阪事務局が企画し、主に関西ローカル（一部全国）で放送されている。\\n晴明神社（せいめいじんじゃ）は、京都市上京区にある神社である。\\n安倍晴明を祀る。\\n一条戻橋のたもと（北西）にあった晴明の屋敷跡に鎮座する。\\n全国各地に同名の神社が存在する。\\n寛弘2年（1005年）に晴明が亡くなると、時の一条天皇は晴明の遺業を賛え、晴明は稲荷神の生まれ変わりであるとして、寛弘4年（1007年）、その屋敷跡に晴明を祀る神社を創建した。\\n当地の社地は広大なものであったが、戦火や豊臣秀吉の都市整備などにより次第に縮小し、社殿も荒れたままの状態となった。\\n幕末以降、氏子らが中心となって社殿・境内の整備が行われ、昭和25年（1950年）には堀川通に面するように境内地が拡張された。\\n平成以降、安倍晴明のブームが起こり、全国から参拝者が訪れるようになった。\\n晴明歿後千年となる平成17年（2005年）には安倍晴明千年祭が行われた。\\n1月1日：新年祭\\n2月節分：節分星祭\\n6月26日：火災除祈願祭\\n9月秋分日：晴明祭\\n前日：宵宮祭\\n当日：例祭、神幸祭\\n9月26日：嵯峨墓所祭\\n11月23日：御火焚祭\\n（三社合祀）：斎稲荷社・天満社・地主社\\nその他\\n「名づけの神様」として、市内の人々が赤ん坊の名前を付けてもらいに参拝することがある。\\n（事前に命名候補を幾つか用意し、その中から神主に陰陽五行に基づき選んでもらう。\\nもしくは両親が選ぶ。）\\n最寄バス停：京都駅より京都市バス9系統一条戻り橋下車\\n京阪四条駅・阪急河原町・烏丸駅より京都市バス12系統\\u3000同下車\\n駐車場：あり（有料）100円/20分\\n大学\\n1639年（寛永16年）、西本願寺が設立した「学寮」を起源とし、大学としては大学令に基づく旧制大学からの歴史を有している。\\n総合大学として8学部を擁し、在籍する学生は2万人を数える。\\n建学の精神\\n「真実を求め真実に生き真実を顕かにする」\\nさらに「平等」「自立」「内省」「感謝」「平和」という5項目を掲げ、浄土真宗の教えに基づく建学の精神を平易な言葉で要約している。\\n江戸時代の学寮、学林時代からの仏教に関する学問的、資料的蓄積があり、多くの宗教学者や著名な僧侶を輩出している。\\n1887年（明治20年）、社会改良運動の機関誌として普通教校学生有志により発刊された「反省会雑誌」は、1899年（明治32年）に「中央公論」と改題され、今日まで続く総合雑誌として発展している。\\n大宮図書館には大谷探検隊のシルクロード将来品の数々が収蔵され

に 始ま る 。\\n臨済 は 黄檗 希 運 の 弟子 で あ り 、 河北 省 の 地 を 拠点 と し 、 新興 の 藩鎮 勢力 で あ っ た 成徳 府 藩鎮 の 王 常侍 を 支持 基盤 と し て 宗勢 を 伸張 し た が 、 唐 末 五代 の 混乱 し た 時期 に は 、 河北 は 5 王朝 を 中心 に 混乱 し た 地域 で あ っ た ため 、 宗勢 が 振る わ な く な る 。\\nこの 時期 の 中心 人物 は 、 風穴 延昭 で あ る 。\\n臨済 宗 が 再び 活気 に 満ち溢れ る よう に な る の は 、 北宋 代 で あ り 、 石霜 楚 円 の 門下 より 、 とも に 江西 省 を 出自 と する 、 黄龍 慧 南 と 楊岐 方 会 と い う 、 臨済 宗 の 主流 と な る 2 派 （ 黄龍 派 ・ 楊岐 派 ） を 生 む 傑僧 が 出 て 、 中国 全土 を 席巻 する こと と な っ た 。\\n南宋 代 に な る と 、 楊岐 派 に 属 する 圜悟 克 勤 の 弟子 の 大慧 宗杲 が 、 浙江 省 を 拠点 と し て 大慧 派 を 形成 し 、 臨済 宗 の 中 の 主流 派 と な っ た 。\\n日本 に おけ る 臨済 宗\\n宗門 で は 、 ゴータマ ・ シッダッタ の 教え （ 悟り ） を 直接 に 受け継 い だ 十 大 弟子 （ 迦葉 ） から 28 代 目 の ボー ディ ダルマ （ 菩提 達磨 ） を 得 て インド から 中国 に 伝え られ た 、 と い う こと に な っ て い る 。\\nその 後 、 禅宗 の 最高 峰 を 極め た 臨済 宗 は 、 南宋 時代 の 中国 に 渡 り 学 ん だ 栄西 ら に よ っ て 、 鎌倉 時代 に 日本 に 伝え られ て い る 。\\n日本 の 臨済 宗 は 、 日本 の 禅 の 宗派 の ひと つ で あ る 。\\n師 から 弟子 へ の 悟り の 伝達 （ 法嗣 、 はっす ） を 重んじ る 。\\n釈迦 を 本師 釈迦 如来 大和尚 と 、 ボー ディ ダルマ を 初祖 菩提 達磨 大師 、 臨済 を 宗祖 臨済 大師 と 呼 ぶ 。\\n同じ 禅宗 の 曹洞 宗 が 地方 豪族 や 一般 民衆 に 広ま っ た の に 対 し 、 臨済 宗 は 時 の 武家 政権 に 支持 さ れ 、 政治 ・ 文化 に 重ん じ られ た 。\\nその 後 時代 を 下り 、 江戸 時代 に 白隠 禅師 に よ っ て 臨済 宗 が 再建 さ れ た ため 、 現在 の 臨済 禅 は 白隠 禅 と も い わ れ て い る 。\\n伝統\\n法嗣 と い う 師匠 から 弟子 へ と 悟り の 伝達 が

わた っ て 活動 し 、 常 に 画壇 の 中心 に あ っ た 専門 画 家 集団 で あ る 。\\n室町 幕府 の 御用 絵師 と な っ た 狩野 正信 を 始祖 と し 、 その 子孫 は 、 室町 幕府 崩壊 後 は 織田 信長 、 豊臣 秀吉 、 徳川 将軍 など に 絵師 と し て 仕え 、 その 時々 の 権力 者 と 結び付 い て 常 に 画壇 の 中心 を 占め 、 内裏 、 城郭 、 大 寺院 など の 障壁 画 から 扇面 など の 小 画面 に 至 る まで 、 あらゆる ジャンル の 絵画 を 手掛け る 職業 画 家 集団 と し て 、 日本 美術 界 に 多大 な 影響 を 及ぼ し た 。\\n狩野 派 は 、 親 ・ 兄弟 など の 血族 関係 を 主軸 と し た 画家 集団 で 、 約 4 世紀 間 の 長期 に わた っ て 一 国 の 画壇 に 君臨 し た と い う 点 で 、 世界 的 に も 他 に ほとんど 例 を 見 な い もの で あ る 。\\n狩野 派 の 代表 的 な 絵師 と し て は 、 室町 幕府 8 代 将軍 足利 義政 に 仕え た 初代 狩野 正信 と その 嫡男 ・ 狩野 元信 、 元信 の 孫 で 安土 城 や 大坂 城 の 障壁 画 を 制作 し た 狩野 永徳 、 永徳 の 孫 で 京都 から 江戸 に 本拠 を 移 し 、 江戸 城 、 二条 城 など の 障壁 画 制作 を 指揮 し た 狩野 探幽 、 京都 に とどま っ て 「 京 狩野 」 と 称 さ れ た 一派 を 代表 する 狩野 山楽 など が 挙げ られ る 。\\n江戸 幕府 の 体制 が 安定 し て 以後 の 狩野 派 は 、 幕府 の 御用 絵師 と し て 、 内裏 、 城郭 など の 障壁 画 の 大量 注文 を こな す 必要 に 迫 ら れ た 。\\n膨大 な 量 の 障壁 画 の 注文 に 応え る ため 、 狩野 家 の 当主 は 、 一門 の 絵師 たち を 率い て 集団 で 制作 に あた る 必要 が あ っ た 。\\nその ため 、 狩野 派 の 絵師 に は 、 絵師 個人 の 個性 の 表出 で は な く 、 先祖 伝来 の 粉本 （ 絵 手本 ） や 筆法 を 忠実 に 学 ぶ こと が 求め られ た 。\\nこう し た 時代 背景 から 、 狩野 探幽 以降 の 狩野 派 は 伝統 の 維持 と 御 用 絵師 と し て の 勢力 保持 に もっぱら 努め 、 芸術 的 創造 性 を 失 っ て い っ た と い う 見 方 も あ る 。\\n芸術 家 の 個性 の 表現 や 内面 の 表出 を 尊重 する 現代 に お い て 、 狩野 派 の 絵画 へ の 評価 は 必ず しも 高 い と は 言え な い 。\\nしかし ながら 、 狩野 派 が 約 4 世紀 に わた っ て 日本 の 画壇 を リード し 、 そこ から 多く の 画家 が 育 っ て い っ た こと も 事実 で あ り 、 良 き に つけ 悪し き に つけ 、 狩野 派 を 抜き に し て 日本 の 絵画 史 を 語 る こと は でき な い 。\\n近世 以降 の 日本 の 画家 の 多く が 狩野 派 の 影響 を 受け 、 狩野 派 の 影響 から 出発 し た こと も 事実 で あ り 、 琳派 の 尾形 光琳 、 写生 派 の 円山 応挙 など も 初期 に は 狩野 派 に 学 ん で い る 。\\n狩野 派 の 祖 は 室町 幕府 の 御用 絵師 と し て 活動 し た 狩野 正信 （ 1434 ? - 1530 ） で あ る 。\\n彼 は 当時 の 日本 人 と し て は 長寿 を 保 ち （ 通説 で は 97 歳 で 没 ） 、 15 世紀 半ば から 16 世紀 前半 まで 活動 し た 。\\n正信 の 出自 は 伊豆 方面 と さ れ て い る が 定か で は な い 。\\n20 世紀 後半 以降 の 研究 の 進展 に よ り 、 狩野 家 は 下野 国 足利 （ 栃木 県 足利 市 ） の 長尾 氏 と 何 ら か の 関係 が あ っ た もの と 推定 さ れ て お り 、 足利 市 の 長 林寺 に 残 る 墨画 の 『 観瀑 図 』 は 正信 の 比較 的 初期 の 作品 と 考え られ て い る 。\\n正信 の 画業 と し て 記録 に 残 る 最初 の 事例 は 、 応仁 の 乱 （ 1467 - 1477 ） の 直前 の 寛正 4 年 （ 1463 年 ） 、 30 歳 の 時 に 京都 の 雲頂 院 （ 相国 寺 塔頭 ） に 観音 と 羅漢 図 の 壁画 を 制作 し た と い う もの で （ 『 蔭涼 軒 日録 』 所載 ） 、 この 時点 で 正信 が すでに 京都 に お い て 画家 と し て 活動 し て い た こと が わか る 。\\n正信 が 壁画 を 描 い た 雲頂 院 の 本寺 で あ る 相国 寺 は 室町 幕府 3 代 将軍 足利 義満 創建 の 禅寺 で 、 如拙 、 周文 、 雪舟 ら の 画僧 を 輩出 し た 室町 画壇 の 中心 的 存在 で あ り 、 この 当時 は 周文 の 弟子 に あた る 画僧 ・ 宗湛 （ 小栗 宗湛 、 1413 - 1481 ） が 御 用 絵師 と し て 活動 し て い た 。\\n狩野 正信 が いつ 上京 し 、 誰 に 師事 し 、 いつ 室町 幕府 の 御用 絵師 と な っ た か 、 正確 な ところ は 不明 で あ る が 、 室町 幕府 8 代 将軍 ・ 足利 義政 に 重用 さ れ て い た こと は 諸 記録 から 明らか で あ る 。\\n10 年 に わた っ た 応仁 の 乱 （ 1467 - 1477 ） 終結 の 数 年 後 の 文明 ( 日本 ) 13 年 （ 1481 年 ） 、 室町 幕府 の 御用 絵師 で あ っ た 宗湛 が 死去 し て お り 、 狩野 正信 は 、 宗湛 の 跡 を 継 い で 幕府 の 御用 絵師 に 任命 さ れ た もの と 思 わ れ る 。\\nこれ 以後 は 、 宮廷 の 絵所 預 （ えどころ あずかり ） の 職 に あ っ た 大和 絵 系 の 土佐 光信 と 、 漢画 系 の 狩野 正信 の 両者 が 画壇 の 二 大 勢力 と な っ た 。\\n文明 14 年 （ 1482 年 ） 、 前 将軍 ・ 足利 義政 は 、 東山 殿 （ 銀閣 寺 の 前身 ） の 造営 を 始め 、 正信 が その 障壁 画 を 担当 する こと と な っ た 。\\n延徳 2 年 （ 1490 年 ） の 義政 の 没後 、 正信 は 当時 政治 の 実権 を 握 っ て い た 細川 氏 に 仕え る よう に な る 。\\n正信 は この よう に 、 時 の 権力 者 と の 結び付き を 深め つつ 画壇 で の 地位 を 固め 、 後 の 狩野 派 隆盛 の 基礎 を 築 い た 。\\n記録 に よ れ ば 、 正信 は 障壁 画 、 仏画 を 含め 、 多様 な 形式 ・ 題材 の 作品 を 手掛け た こと が 知 ら れ る が 、 障壁 画 は ことごとく 失 わ れ 、 現存 する 確実 な 作品 は 掛軸 など の 小 画面 に 限 ら れ て い る 。\\nその 画風 は 、 同 時代 人 の 土佐 光信 の 伝統 的 な 大和 絵 風 と は 対照 的 に 、 水墨 を 基調 と し 、 中国 宋 ・ 元 の 画法 を 元 に し た 「 漢画 」 で あ っ た 。\\n正信 は 97 歳 の 長寿 を 保 っ た が 、 晩年 の 約 30 年間 の 事績 は 明らか で な く 、 嫡男 の 元信 に 画業 を 継 が せ て 引退 生活 を 送 っ て い た 模様 で あ る 。\\n狩野 派 隆盛 の 基盤 を 築 い た 、 2 代 目 ・ 狩野 元信 （ 1476 - 1559 ） は 正信 の 嫡男 で 、 文明 8 年 （ 1476 年 ） に 生まれ た 。\\n現存 する 代表 作 は 大徳 寺 大仙 院 方丈 の 障壁 画 （ 方丈 は 永正 10 年 （ 1513 年 ） に 完成 ） 、 天文 ( 元号 ) 12 年 （ 1543 年 ） の 妙心 寺 霊 雲 院 障壁 画 など で あ る （ 大仙 院 障壁 画 に つ い て は 、 方丈 竣工 時 の 作品 で は な く 、 やや 後 の 年代 の 作 と する 見 方 が 有力 で あ る ） 。\\n大仙 院 方丈 障壁 画 は 相 阿弥 、 元信 と 弟 ・ 狩野 之信 が 部屋 ごと に 制作 を 分担 し て お り 、 元信 が 担当 し た の は 「 檀那 の 間 」 の 『 四季 花鳥 図 』 と 、 「 衣鉢 の 間 」 の 『 禅宗 祖師 図 』 など で あ っ た 。\\nこの うち 、 『 禅宗 祖師 図 』 は 典型 的 な 水墨 画 で あ る が 、 『 四季 花鳥 図 』 は 水墨 を 基調 と し つつ 、 草花 や 鳥 の 部分 に のみ 濃彩 を 用い て 新し い 感覚 を 示 し て い る 。\\n元信 は 時 の 権力 者 で あ っ た 足利 将軍 や 細川 家 と の 結び付き を 強め 、 多く の 門弟 を 抱え て 、 画家 集団 と し て の 狩野 派 の 基盤 を 確か な もの に し た 。\\n武家 だけ で な く 、 公家 、 寺社 など から の 注文 に も 応え 、 寺社 関係 で は 、 大坂 に あ っ た 石山 本願 寺 の 障壁 画 を 元信 が 手掛け た こと が 記録 から 分か っ て い る が 、 これ は 現存 し な い 。\\n元信 は 晩年 に は 「 越前 守 」 を 名乗 り 、 また 「 法眼 （ ほうげん ） 」 と い う 僧位 を 与え られ た こと から 、 後世 に は 「 古 法眼 」 「 越前 法眼 」 など と 称 さ れ て い る 。\\n作品 の レパートリー は 幅広 く 、 障壁 画 の ほか 、 寺社 の 縁起 絵巻 、 絵馬 、 大和 絵 風 の 金屏風 、 肖像 画 など も 手掛け て い る 。\\n元信 は 父 正信 の 得意 と し た 漢画 、 水墨 画 に 大和 絵 の 画法 を 取り入れ 、 襖 、 屏風 など の 装飾 的 な 大 画面 を 得意 と し 、 狩野 派 様式 の 基礎 を 築 い た 。\\nまた 、 書道 の 楷書 、 行書 、 草書 に なら っ て 、 絵画 に おけ る 「 真体 、 行 体 、 草体 」 と い う 画体 の 概念 を 確立 し 、 近世 障壁 画 の 祖 と も 言 わ れ て い る 。\\n元信 に は 宗信 、 秀頼 、 直信 の 3 人 の 男子 が あ っ た が 、 長男 の 宗信 は 早世 し た ため 、 宗家 を 継 い だ の は 三男 の 直信 （ 1519 - 1592 ） で あ っ た 。\\nなぜ 二男 の 秀頼 で な く 三男 の 直信 に 家督 を 継 が せ た の か は 定か で な い 。\\n直信 は 、 道 名 の 狩野 松栄 の 名 で 広 く 知 ら れ 、 室町 から 桃山 に 至 る 時代 に 活動 し た 。\\n代表 作 と し て は 、 大徳 寺 に 残 る 巨大 な 『 涅槃 図 』 （ 縦 約 6 m ） が あ る 。\\nまた 、 父 ・ 元信 と とも に 石山 本願 寺 障壁 画 制作 に 参加 し て お り 、 大徳 寺 聚光 院 （ じゅこう いん ） 障壁 画 制作 に は 息子 の 永徳 と とも に 参加 し て い る が 、 父 ・ 元信 と 息子 ・ 永徳 が それぞれ に 高名 で あ る ため に 、 やや 地味 な 存在 と な っ て い る 。\\n松栄 の 嫡男 ・ 狩野 永徳 （ 1543 - 1590 ） は 州信 （ くにのぶ ） と も 称 し 、 桃山 時代 の 日本 画壇 を 代表 する 人物 で あ る 。\\n織田 信長 、 豊臣 秀吉 と い っ た 乱世 を 生き 抜 い た 権力 者 の 意向 に 敏感 に 応え 、 多く の 障壁 画 を 描 い た が 、 これ ら 障壁 画 は 建物 と とも に 消滅 し 、 現存 する 永徳 の 作品 は 比較 的 少な い 。\\n現存 する 代表 作 の 一 つ で あ る 大徳 寺 聚光 院 方丈 障壁 画 は 永徳 と 父 ・ 松栄 の 分担 制作 で あ る が 、 父 ・ 松栄 は 方丈 南側 正面 の 主要 な 部屋 の 襖絵 を 息子 の 永徳 に まかせ 、 自分 は 脇役 に 回 っ て い る 。\\n封建 社会 の 当時 に あ っ て は 、 家門 の 長 が 主要 な 部屋 の 襖絵 を 描 く の が 常識 で あ り 、 この 障壁 画 制作 時 に は 松栄 は 才能 豊か な 永徳 に 家督 を 譲 っ て 、 自身 は すでに 隠居 の 身 で あ っ た と 考証 さ れ て い る 。\\n聚光 院 方丈 障壁 画 の うち 、 室中 （ しっちゅう 、 方丈 正面 中央 の 部屋 ） を 飾 る 『 花鳥 図 』 は 特に 評価 が 高 い 。\\nその 後 、 永徳 は 天正 4 - 7 年 （ 1576 - 1579 年 ） 、 織田 信長 が 建立 し た 安土 城 天守 の 障壁 画 制作 に 携わ っ た 。\\n信長 亡 き 後 は 豊臣 秀吉 の 大坂 城 や 聚楽 第 の 障壁 画 を 制作 し 、 晩年 に は 内裏 の 障壁 画 制作 に も 携わ っ た 。\\nこれ ら の 作品 群 は 、 当時 の 日記 や 記録 類 に その 斬新 さ を 高 く 評価 さ れ て お り 、 現存 し て い れ ば 永徳 の 代表 作 と な っ た で あ ろ う が 、 建物 と とも に 障壁 画 も 消滅 し て しま っ た 。\\n現存 する 永徳 の 代表 作 と し て は 、 前述 の 聚光 院 方丈 障壁 画 の ほか 、 旧 御物 の 『 唐 獅子 図 屏風 』 、 上杉 氏 伝来 の 『 洛中 洛外 図 屏風 』 が 名高 く 、 東京 国立 博物 館 の 『 檜図 屏風 』 も 古来 永徳 筆 と 伝え る もの で あ る 。\\n永徳 は 細画 （ さいが ） と 大画 （ たいが ） の いずれ を も 得意 と し た が 、 大量 の 障壁 画 の 注文 を こな す ため に 、 大画 様式 で 描 か ざる を え な かっ た と い う 。\\n細画 と は 細部 まで 細か く 描き込 ん だ 絵 、 大画 は 豪放 な 作風 の 絵 と 解釈 さ れ て い る 。\\n近世 初期 の 狩野 派 に は 他 に も 重要 な 画家 が 多 い 。\\n国宝 の 『 高雄 観楓 図 』 に は 「 秀頼 」 の 印 が あ り 、 古来 、 狩野 元信 の 次男 ・ 狩野 秀頼 （ 生没年 未詳 ） の 作 と さ れ て い る が 、 『 高雄 観楓 図 』 の 筆者 の 「 秀頼 」 は 別人 で 、 元信 の 孫 に あた る 真笑 秀頼 と い う 絵師 だ と も 言 わ れ て い る 。\\n狩野 宗秀 （ そうしゅう 、 1551 - 1601 ） は 元秀 （ もとひで ） と も 称し 永徳 の 弟 で 、 安土 城 障壁 画 制作 など で 永徳 の 助手 と し て 働 い た 。\\n屏風 、 肖像 画 など の 現存 作 が あ る 。\\nやはり 永徳 の 弟 で あ る 狩野 長信 （ 1577 - 1654 ） は 『 花下 遊楽 図 』 （ 国宝 ） の 筆者 と し て 名高 い 。\\n狩野 家 直系 以外 の 絵師 と し て は 、 川越 ・ 喜多 院 の 『 職人 尽 図 屏風 』 の 筆者 で あ る 狩野 吉信 （ 1552 - 1640 ） 、 京都 ・ 豊国 神社 ( 京都 市 ) の 『 豊国 祭 図 屏風 』 の 筆者 で あ る 狩野 内膳 （ 1570 - 1616 ） ら が 知 ら れ る 。\\n狩野 永徳 は 父 の 松栄 （ 直信 ） に 先立 っ て 48 歳 で 没 し た 。\\nその 後 を 継 い だ の は 永徳 の 長男 ・ 狩野 光信 （ 1565 ? - 1608 ） と 次男 ・ 狩野 孝信 （ 1571 - 1618 ） で あ る 。\\n光信 は 、 園城 寺 勧学院 客殿 障壁 画 など を 残 し 、 永徳 と は 対照 的 な 、 大和 絵 風 の 繊細 な 画風 を 特色 と し た 。\\nこう し た 画風 が 制作 当時 の 一般 的 な 好み に 合致 し な かっ た ため か 、 『 本朝 画 史 』 など の 近世 の 画論 は 一様 に 光信 を 低 く 評価 し て い る 。\\n狩野 家 の 頭領 で あ る 光信 が 死去 し た 時 、 その 子 の 狩野 貞信 （ 1597 - 1623 ） は まだ 12 歳 の 若年 で あ っ た の で 、 光信 の 弟 で あ る 孝信 が 狩野 派 を 率い る こと と な っ た 。\\n封建 制度 の 下 で は 、 光信 の 長男 で あ る 貞信 の 家系 が 宗家 と な る はず で あ っ た が 、 貞信 が 27 歳 で 早世 し 後継ぎ が な かっ た ため 、 以後 、 幕末 に 至 る 狩野 家 の 正系 は 孝信 の 子孫 と な っ て い る 。\\n孝信 に は 守信 （ 探幽 、 1602 - 1674 ） 、 狩野 尚信 （ 1607 - 1650 ） 、 狩野 安信 （ 1613 - 1685 ） の 3 人 の 男子 が あ り 、 この 3 人 は それぞれ 鍛冶 橋 狩野家 、 木挽 町 （ こびき ちょう ） 狩野 家 、 中橋 狩野家 （ 宗家 ） の 祖 と な っ た 。\\n末弟 の 安信 は 前述 の 貞信 の 養子 と い う 扱い で 狩野 の 宗家 を 継 ぐ こと に な っ た が 、 絵師 と し て 最も 名高 い の は 探幽 こと 守信 で あ る 。\\n守信 は 、 後 に 出家 し て 探幽 斎 と 称 し 、 画家 と し て は 狩野 探幽 の 名 で 知 ら れ る 。\\n後 に 江戸 に 本拠 を 移 し 、 江戸 幕府 の 御用 絵師 と し て 、 画壇 に おけ る 狩野 派 の 地位 を ますます 不動 の もの と し た 。\\n探幽 は 幼少 時 より 画才 を 発揮 し 、 慶長 17 年 （ 1612 年 ） 、 11 歳 の 時 に 駿府 で 徳川 家康 に 対面 、 元和 ( 日本 ) 7 年 （ 1621 年 ） に は 江戸 鍛冶橋 門外 に 屋敷 を 得 て 、 以後 江戸 を 拠点 に 活動 し 、 城郭 や 大 寺院 など の 障壁 画 を 精力 的 に 制作 し た 。\\n探幽 の 作品 の うち 、 江戸 城 と 大坂 城 の 障壁 画 は 建物 と とも に 消滅 し た が 、 名古屋 城 上洛 殿 の 障壁 画 （ 水墨 ） は 第 二 次 大戦 時 に は 建物 から 取り外 し て 疎開 さ せ て あ っ た ため 空襲 を まぬがれ て 現存 し て お り 、 他 に 二条 城 二の丸 御殿 や 大徳 寺 方丈 の 障壁 画 が 現存 する 代表 作 で あ る 。\\nこれ ら 大 画面 の ほか に も 、 掛軸 、 絵巻 、 屏風 など あらゆる ジャンル の 作品 を 残 し て い る 。\\n二条 城 二の丸 御殿 障壁 画 は 25 歳 の 若描 き で 、 永徳 風 の 豪壮 な 画風 を 示 す が 、 後年 の 大徳 寺 の 障壁 画 は 水墨 を 主体 と し 、 余白 を たっぷり と 取 っ た 穏やか な 画風 の もの で あ る 。\\n絵巻 や 屏風 に は 大和 絵 風 の 作品 も あ る 。\\n探幽 は 写生 （ スケッチ ） や 古画 の 模写 を 重視 し 、 写生 図 集 や 模写 画集 を 多数 残 し て い る 。\\n「 探幽 縮図 」 と 称 さ れ る 探幽 筆 の 古画 模写 は 多数 現存 し て お り 、 各地 の 美術 館 や 収集 家 が 所蔵 し て い る が 、 これ ら に は 今日 で は 原画 が 失 わ れ て しま っ た 古画 の 模写 も 多数 含 ま れ て お り 、 日本 絵画 史 研究 上 、 貴重 な 資料 と な っ て い る 。\\n江戸 時代 の 狩野 派 は 、 狩野 家 の 宗家 を 中心 と し た 血族 集団 と 、 全国 に い る 多数 の 門人 から な る 巨大 な 画家 集団 で あ り 、 ピラミッド 型 の 組織 を 形成 し て い た 。\\n「 奥 絵師 」 と 呼 ば れ る 、 もっとも 格式 の 高 い 4 家 を 筆頭 に 、 それ に 次 い で 格式 の 高 い 「 表 絵師 」 が 約 15 家 あ り 、 その 下 に は 公儀 や 寺社 の 画事 で は な く 、 一般 町人 の 需要 に 応え る 「 町 狩野 」 が 位置 する と い う よう に 、 明確 に 格付け が さ れ 、 その 影響 力 は 日本 全国 に 及 ん で い た 。\\nこの 時代 の 権力 者 は 封建 社会 の 安定 継続 を 望 み 、 江戸 城 の よう な 公 の 場 に 描 か れ る 絵画 は 、 新奇 な もの より 伝統 的 な 粉本 に 則 っ て 描 か れ た もの が 良し と さ れ た 。\\nまた 、 大量 の 障壁 画 制作 を こな す に は 、 弟子 一門 を 率い て 集団 で 制作 する 必要 が あ り 、 集団 制作 を 容易 に する ため に も 絵師 個人 の 個性 より も 粉本 （ 絵 手本 ） を 学習 する こと が 重視 さ れ た 。\\nこう し た 点 から 、 狩野 派 の 絵画 は 、 個性 や 新味 に 乏し い もの に な っ て い っ た こと は 否め な い 。\\n奥 絵師 は 旗本 と 同格 で 、 将軍 へ の 「 お目見え 」 と 帯刀 が 許 さ れ た と い う から 、 その 格式 の 高 さ が うかがえ る 。\\n奥 絵師 の 4 家 と は 探幽 （ 狩野 孝信 の 長男 ） の 系統 の 鍛冶 橋 家 、 尚信 （ 孝信 の 次男 ） の 系統 の 木挽 町家 （ 当初 は 「 竹川 町家 」 ） 、 安信 （ 孝信 の 三男 ） の 系統 の 中橋 家 、 それ に 狩野 岑信 （ みねのぶ 、 1662 - 1708 ） の 系統 の 浜町 家 で あ る （ 岑信 は 、 狩野 尚信 の 長男 で あ

る べ き 画家 は 出 な かっ た 。\\n探幽 に は 多く の 弟子 が い た が 、 中 で は 『 夕顔 棚 納涼 図 』 を 残 し た 久隅 守景 （ くすみ もりかげ 、 生没年 未詳 ） が 著名 で あ る 。\\n守景 は 何 ら か の 事情 で 狩野 派 を 破門 に な り 、 後 に は 金沢 方面 で 制作 し た が 、 経歴 に つ い て 不明 な 点 が 多 い 。\\n前述 の とおり 、 狩野 家 の 宗家 は 、 探幽 の 弟 ・ 安信 の 中橋 家 が 継 ぐ こと に な っ た 。\\n安信 の 子 の 狩野 時信 （ 1642 - 1678 ） は 30 代 で 没 し 、 その 子 の 狩野 主信 （ うじのぶ 、 1675 - 1724 ） が 家督 を 継 ぐ が 、 この 系統 から も その 後 目立 っ た 画人 は 出

1636 - 1713 ） 、 その 子 の 狩野 周信 （ ちかのぶ 、 1660 - 1728 ） と 狩野 岑信 （ みねのぶ 、 1662 - 1708 ） ら が 出 て い る 。\\n岑信 は 将軍 ・ 徳川 家宣 の 寵愛 を 受け 、 後 に 「 浜町 家 」 と し て 独立 し 、 「 奥 絵師 家 」 の 1 つ に 数え られ る よう に な っ た 。\\nこの ほか 、 狩野 興 以 （ ? - 1636 ） は 狩野 家 の 血族 で は な い が 、 探幽 ら 3 兄弟 の 師匠 筋 に あた る 人物 で 、 その 功績 に よ っ て 狩野 姓 を 与え られ 、 後 に 紀州 徳川 家 に 仕え て い る 。\\n一方 、 京都 に 残 っ て 活動 を 続け た 「 京 狩野 」 と い う 一派 も あ り 、 狩野 永徳 の 弟子 で あ

。\\n山楽 の 娘婿 で 養子 の 狩野 山雪 （ 1589 / 90 - 1651 ） は 、 妙心 寺 天球 院 障壁 画 の ほか 、 屏風 絵 など の 現存 作 が あ る 。\\n樹木 、 岩 など の 独特 の 形態 、 徹底 し た 細部 描写 など 、 狩野 派 の 絵師 の 中 で は 異色 の 個性 的 な 画風 を も つ 。\\n山雪 の 残 し た 画論 を 、 子 の 狩野 永納 （ 1631 - 1697 ） が まとめ た もの が 、 日本 人 に よ る 本格 的 な 絵画 史 と し て は 最初 の もの と さ れ る 『 本朝 画 史 』 で あ る 。\\n木挽 町家 から は 、 江戸 時代 後期 に 狩野 典信 （ えいせんいん みちのぶ 、 1730 - 1790 ） 、 狩野 惟信 （ よう せんいん これ のぶ 、 1753 - 1808 ） 、 狩野 栄信 （ いせんいん ながのぶ 、 1775 - 1828 ） 、 狩野 養信 （ せいせんいん おさ のぶ 、 1786 - 1846 ） など が 出 て い る 。\\n晴川院 養信 は 、 天保 9 年 （ 1838 年 ） と 同 15 年 （ 1844 年 ） に 相 次 い で 焼失 し た 江戸 城 の 西 の 丸 および 本丸 御殿 の 再建 に 際 し 、 膨大 な 障壁 画 の 制作 を 狩野 派 の 棟梁 と し て 指揮 し た 。\\n障壁 画 その もの は 現存 し な い が 、 膨大 な 下絵 が 東京 国立 博物 館 に 所蔵 さ れ て い る 。\\n晴川 院 は 古画 の 模写 や 収集 に も 尽力 し た 。\\n一般 に 、 江戸 時代 後期 の 狩野 派 絵師 に 対 する 評価 は あまり 高 く な い が 、 20 世紀 後半 以降 の 研究 の 進展 に よ り 、 晴川 院 は 古典 絵画 から 幕末 の 新し い 絵画 の 動き まで 熱心 に 研究 し た 、 高 い 技術 を も っ た 絵師 で あ っ た こと が 認識 さ れ る よう に な り 、 再 評価 の 動き が あ る 。\\n晴川院 の 次代 の 狩野 雅信 （ しょう せんいん ただ のぶ 、 1823 - 1880 ） の 門下 に は 、 明治 初期 の 日本 画壇 の 重鎮 と な っ た 狩野 芳崖 （ 下関 出身 、 1828 - 1888 ） と 橋本 雅邦 （ 川越 出身 、 1835 - 1908 ） が い た 。\\n芳崖 と 雅邦 は とも に 地方 の 狩野 派 系 絵師 の 家 の 出身 で あ っ た 。\\n職業 絵師 集団 と し て の 狩野 派 は 、 パトロン で あ っ

挙げ た 。\\n諸国 に 多数 の 軍勢 催促 状 を 発 し 、 近江 国 の 佐々木 道誉 など の 御 家人 を 従え て 入京 し 、 同年 5 月 7 日 に 六波羅 探題 を 滅亡 さ せ た 。\\n同 時期 に 上野 国 の 御 家人 で あ る 新田 義貞 も 挙兵 し て お り 、 高氏 の 嫡子 で 鎌倉 から 脱出 し た 千寿 王 （ 後 の 足利 義詮 ） を 奉 じ て 鎌倉 へ 進軍 し 、 幕府 を 滅亡 さ せ た 。\\nこの 時 、 高氏 の 側室 の 子 ・ 竹若 丸 が 混乱 の 最中 に 殺 さ れ て い る 。\\n高氏 は 鎌倉 陥落後 に 細川 和 氏 ・ 細川 頼春 ・ 細川 師 氏 の 兄弟 を 派遣 し て 義貞 を 上洛 さ せ 、 鎌倉 を 足利 方 に 掌握 さ せ て い る 。\\n鎌倉 幕府 の 滅亡 後 、 高氏 は 後 醍醐 天皇 から 勲功 第 一 と さ れ 、 鎮守 府 将軍 および 従 四 位 下 左兵衛 督 に 任 ぜ られ 、 また に 30 箇所 の 所領 を 与え られ た 。\\nさらに 天皇 の 諱 ・ 尊治 から 御 一 字 を 賜 り 尊氏 と 改名 し た 。\\n尊氏 は 建武 政権 で は 政治 の 中枢 から はなれ て お り 、 足利 家 の 執事 職 で あ る 高師直 ・ 高師 泰 兄弟 など を 送り込 み 、 弟 ・ 足利 直義 を 鎌倉 将軍 府 執権 と し た 。\\nこれ に は 後 醍醐 天皇 が 尊氏 を 敬遠 し た と する 見 方 と 、 尊氏 自身 が 政権 と 距離 を 置 い た と する 見 方 と が あ る 。\\nまた 、 征夷 大 将軍 の 宣下 を 受け 、 鎌倉 に 幕府 を 開 く 意図 が あ っ た と する 説 も あ る 。\\nこの 状態 は 「 新政 に 尊氏 なし 」 と 言 わ れ た 。\\n後 醍醐 天皇 が 北畠 顕家 を 鎮守 府 将軍 に 任 じ て 幼 い 義良 親王 （ 後 の 後 村上 天皇 ） を 奉 じ させ て 奥州 鎮定 に 向か わ せ る と 、 尊氏 は 直義 に 幼 い 成良 親王 を 奉 じ させ 鎌倉 へ 下向 さ せ て い る 。\\n後 醍醐 天皇 の 皇子 で あ り 同じく 征夷 大 将軍 職 を 望 ん で い た 護良 親王 は 尊氏 と 対立 し 、 尊氏 暗殺 を 試み る が 尊氏 側 の 警護 が 厳重 で 果たせ な かっ た 。\\n建武 ( 日本 ) 元年 （ 1334 年 ） 、 尊氏 は 、 実子 恒良 親王 を 皇太子 と し た い 後 醍醐 天皇 の 寵姫 阿野 廉子 と 結 び 、 後 醍醐 天皇 と も 確執 し て い た 護良 親王 を 捕縛 し 鎌倉 の 直義 の もと に 幽閉 さ せ る 。\\n建武 2 年 （ 1335 年 ） に 信濃 国 で 、 北条 高時 の 遺児 北条 時行 を 擁立 し た 北条 氏 残党 の 反乱 で あ る 中 先代 の 乱 が 起こ り 、 時行 軍 は 鎌倉 を 一時 占拠 する 。\\nその 際 、 直義 が 独断 で 護良 親王 を 殺 し た 。\\n尊氏 は 後 醍醐 天皇 に 征夷 大 将軍 の 官 を 望 む が 得 られ ず 、 同年 8 月 2 日 、 勅 状 を 得 な い まま 鎌倉 へ 進発 し 、 後 醍醐 天皇 は やむな く 征東 大将軍 の 号 を 与え た 。\\n尊氏 は 直義 の 兵 と 合流 し 相模 川 の 戦い で 時行 を 駆逐 し て 、 同月 19 日 に は 鎌倉 を 回復 し た 。\\n尊氏 は 従 二 位 に 叙 せ られ た 。\\n直義 の 意向 も あ っ て 尊氏 は その まま 鎌倉 に 本拠 を 置 き 、 独自 に 恩賞 を 与え 始め 京都 から の 上洛 の 命令 を 拒 み 、 独自 の 武家 政権 創始 の 動き を 見せ 始め た 。\\n同年 11 月 、 尊氏 は 新田 義貞 を 君側 の 奸 で あ る と し て 後 醍醐 天皇 に その 討伐 を 上奏 する が 、 後 醍醐 天皇 は 逆 に 義貞 に 尊良 親王 を 奉 じ させ て 尊氏 討伐 を 命 じ 、 東海道 を 鎌倉 へ 向か わ せ た 。\\nさらに 奥州 から は 北畠 顕家 も 南下 を 始め て お り 、 尊氏 は 赦免 を 求め て 隠居 を 宣言 する が 、 直義 ・ 高師直 など の 足利 方 が 三河 国 など 各地 で 敗れ はじめ る と 、 尊氏 は 建武 政権 に 叛旗 を 翻 す こと を 決意 する 。\\n同年 12 月 、 尊氏 は 新田 軍 を 箱根 ・ 竹ノ 下 の 戦い で 破 り 、 京都 へ 進軍 を 始め た 。\\nこの 間 、 尊氏 は 持明 院 統 の 光厳 天皇 へ 連絡 を 取 り 、 京都 進軍 の 正統 性 を 得 る 工作 を し て い る 。\\n建武 3 年 正月 、 尊氏 は 入京 を 果た し 、 後 醍醐 天皇 は 比叡山 へ 退 い た 。\\nしかし ほど なく し て 奥州 から 上洛 し た 北畠 顕家 と 楠木 正成 ・ 新田 義貞 の 攻勢 に 会 っ た 尊氏 は 同年 2 月 、 京都 を 放棄 し て 赤松 円心 の 進言 を 容れ て 九州 に 下 っ た 。\\n九州 へ の 西下 途上 、 長門 国 赤間 関 （ 山口 県 下関 市 ） で 少弐 頼尚 に 迎え られ 、 筑前 国 宗像 の 宗像 大社 宮司 宗像 氏範 の 支援 を 受け る 。\\n宗像 大社 参拝 後 の 3 月 初旬 、 筑前 多々良 浜 （ 福岡 市 東 区 ( 福岡 市 ) ） で の 多々良 浜 の 戦い に お い て 後 醍醐 天皇 方 の 菊池 武敏 を 破 り 勢力 を 立て直 し た 尊氏 は 、 京 に 上 る 途中 で 光厳 上皇 の 院宣 を 獲得 し 、 西国 の 武士 を 急速 に 傘下 に 集め て 再び 東上 し た 。\\n同年 4 月 25 日 の 湊川 の 戦い で 新田 義貞 ・ 楠木 正成 の 軍 を 破 り 、 同年 6 月 、 京都 を 再び 制圧 し た 。\\n京 へ 入 っ た 尊氏 は 、 比叡山 に 逃れ て い た 後 醍醐 天皇 の 顔 を 立て る 形 で の 和議 を 申し入れ た 。\\n和議 に 応 じ た 後 醍醐 天皇 は 同年 11 月 2 日 に 光厳 上皇 の 弟 光明 天皇 に 神器 を 譲 り 、 その 直後 の 11 月 7 日 、 尊氏 は 建武 式目 十 七 条 を 定め て 政権 の 基本 方針 を 示 し 、 新た な 武家 政権 の 成立 を 宣言 し た 。\\n一方 、 後 醍醐 天皇 は 同年 12 月 に 三種 の 神器 を 帯 し て 京都 を 脱出 し て 吉野 （ 奈良 県 吉野 郡 吉野 町 ） へ 逃れ 、 光明 に 譲 っ た 神器 は 偽 で あ る と 宣言 し て 吉野 朝廷 を 開 い た 。\\n延元 3 年 / 暦応 元年 （ 1338 年 ） 、 尊氏 は 光明 天皇 から 征夷 大 将軍 に 任 じ られ （ 在職 1338 年 - 1358 年 ） 、 ここ に 、 後 に 室町 幕府 と 呼 ば れ る こと に な る 武家 政権 が 名実 とも に 成立 し た 。\\n翌年 、 後 醍醐 天皇 が 吉野 で 死去 する と 、 尊氏 は 慰霊 の ため に 天龍 寺 造営 を 開始 し た 。\\n造営 費 を 支弁 する ため 、 元 ( 王朝 ) へ 天龍 寺 船 が 派遣 さ れ て い る 。\\n新 政権 に お い て 、 尊氏 は 政務 を 直義 に 任せ 、 自ら は 武士 の 棟梁 と し て 君臨 し た 。\\n佐藤 進一 は 「 室町 幕府 論 」 （ 『 岩波 講座 日本 歴史 7 』 、 岩波 書店 、 1963 ） に お い て 、 この 状態 を 、 主従 制 的 支配 権 を 握 る 尊氏 と 統治 権 的 支配 権 を 所管 する 直義 と の 両頭 政治 で あ り 、 鎌倉 幕府 以来 、 将軍 が 有 し て い た 権力 の 二元 性 が 具現 し た もの と 評価 し た 。\\n二元 化 し た 権力 は 徐々 に 幕府 内部 の 対立 を 呼び起こ し て い き 、 高師直 ら の 反 直義 派 と 直義 派 の 対立 と し て 現れ て い く 。\\nこの 対立 は ついに 観応 の 擾乱 と 呼 ば れ る 内部 抗争 に 発展 し た 。\\n尊氏 は 当初 、 中立 的 立場 を 取 っ て い た が 、 師直 派 に 擁立 さ れ て しま う 。\\n正平 ( 日本 ) 4 年 / 貞和 5 年 （ 1349 年 ） 、 襲撃 を 受け た 直義 が 逃げ込 ん だ 尊氏 邸 を 師直 の 兵 が 包囲 し 、 直義 の 引退 を 求め る 事件 が 発生 し た 。\\n直義 は 出家 し 政務 を 退 く こと と な っ た が 、 直義 の 排除 に は 師直 ・ 尊氏 の 間 で 了解 が あ り 、 積極 的 に 意図 さ れ て い た と する 説 が あ る 。\\n尊氏 は 直義 に 代わ っ て 政務 を 担当 さ せ る ため 嫡男 義詮 を 鎌倉 から 呼び戻 し 、 代わり に 次男 足利 基氏 を 下 し て 鎌倉 公方 と し 、 東国 統治 の ため の 鎌倉 府 を 設置 し た 。\\n直義 の 引退 後 、 尊氏 庶子 で 直義 猶子 の 足利 直冬 が 九州 で 直義 派 と し て 勢力 を 拡大 し て い た ため 、 正平 5 年 / 観応 元年 （ 1350 年 ） 、 尊氏 は 直冬 討伐 の ため に 中国 地方 へ 遠征 し た 。\\nする と 直義 は 京都 を 脱出 し て 南 朝 方 に 付 き 、 桃井 直常 、 畠山 国 清 ら 一部 の 譜代 の 武将 たち も これ に 従 っ た 。\\n直義 の 勢力 が 強大 に な る と 、 義詮 は 劣勢 と な っ て 京 を 脱出 し 、 尊氏 も 直義 に 摂津 国 打出 浜 （ 兵庫 県 西宮 市 ） で 敗れ た 。\\n尊氏 は 高 兄弟 の 出家 を 条件 に 直義 と 和睦 し 、 正平 6 年 / 観応 2 年 （ 1351 年 ） に 和議 が 成立 し た 。\\n高 兄弟 は 護送 中 に 上杉 能憲 に よ り 謀殺 さ れ て い る 。\\n直義 は 義詮 の 補佐 と し て 政務 に 復帰 し た 。\\n尊氏 ・ 義詮 は 佐々木 道誉 や 赤松 則祐 の 謀反 を 名目 と し て 近江 ・ 播磨 へ 出陣 し 、 実際 に は 直義 ・ 直冬 追討 を 企て て 南 朝 方 と 和睦 交渉 を 行な っ た 。\\nこの 動き に 対 し て 直義 は 北陸 方面 へ 脱出 し て 鎌倉 へ 逃げ た 。\\n尊氏 と 南朝 の 和睦 は 同年 10 月 に 成立 し 、 これ を 正平 一統 と い う 。\\n平行 し て 尊氏 は 直義 を 追 っ て 東海道 を 進 み 、 駿河 薩捶 山 （ 静岡 県 静岡 市 清水 区 ） 、 相模 早 川尻 （ 神奈川 県 小田原 市 ） など で の 戦闘 で 撃ち破 り 、 直義 を 捕らえ て 鎌倉 に 幽閉 し た 。\\n直義 は 、 正平 7 年 / 観応 3 年 （ 1352 年 ） 2 月 に 急死 し た 。\\n『 太平 記 』 は 尊氏 に よ る 毒殺 の 疑い を 記 し て い る 。\\nその 直後 に 宗良 親王 、 新田 義興 ・ 新田 義宗 、 北条 時行 など の 南 朝 方 から 襲撃 さ れ た 尊氏 は 武蔵 国 へ 退却 する が 、 すぐさま 反撃 し 関東 の 南朝 勢力 を 制圧 する と 、 京都 へ 戻 っ た 。\\nその 後 足 利 直冬 が 京都 へ 侵攻 する が 、 結局 直冬 は 九州 へ 去 る 。\\n正平 9 年 / 文和 3 年 （ 1354 年 ） に も 京都 を 南朝 に 一時 奪 わ れ る が 、 翌年 奪還 し た 。\\n尊氏 は 自ら 直冬 討伐 を 企て る が 、 正平 13 年 / 延文 3 年 4 月 30 日 （ 1358 年 ） 、 背中 に 出来 た 癰 （ よう 、 腫物 ） の ため 、 京都 二条 万里小路 邸 にて 死去 し た 。\\n享年 54 。\\n『 梅松 論 』 など に よ る と 、 尊氏 は 後醍醐 に 背 い て 朝敵 と な っ た こと を 悔や ん で 一時 は 出家 を 宣言 し たり 、 合戦 で 苦戦 し た 際 に は 切腹 する と 言 い 出 す など の 記述 が あ り 、 佐藤 進一 は 尊氏 を 躁鬱 病 で は な い か と 推測 し て い る 。\\n個人 的 に 親交 の あ っ た 夢窓 疎石 は 、 尊氏 の 徳 を 評価 し た 文章 を 残 し て い る 。\\n尊氏 は 傘下 の 武将 たち へ の 恩賞 を 惜し む こと が な く 、 その こと が 苦境 に 立た さ れ て も 常 に 武将 たち の 支持 が 得 られ た 理由 だ と する 見解 も あ る 。\\n尊氏 を 逆賊 と する 評価 は 、 江戸 時代 に 徳川 光圀 が 創始 し た 水戸 学 に 始ま る 。\\n水戸 学 は 朱子 学 名 分 論 の 影響 を 強 く 受け て お り 、 皇統 の 正統 性 を 重視 し て い た 。\\nその ため 、 正統 な 天皇 （ 後醍醐 天皇 ） を 放逐 し た 尊氏 は 逆賊 と し て 否定 的 に 描 か れ る こと と な っ た 。\\n水戸 学 に 発 する 尊氏 観 は その 後 も 継承 さ れ 、 尊王 思想 が 高ま っ た 幕末 期 に は 尊皇 攘夷 論 者 に よ っ て 等 持 院 の 尊氏 ・ 義詮 ・ 義満 3 代 の 木像 が 梟首 さ れ る 事件 も 発生 し て い る 。\\n明治 時代 に な る と 、 明治 政府 の 立場 から 天皇 を 中心 と する 国民 国家 を 建設 する ため 、 国家 主義 的 な 歴史 観 が 構築 さ れ て い っ た が 、 それ は 大政 奉還 ・ 王政 復古 を 正当 化 する 歴史 観 で あ り 、 その ため 大化 の 改新 ・ 建武 の 中興 ・ 明治 維新 が 最も 重要 な 改革 に 位置 づけ られ た 。\\n明治 中期 まで は 近代 的 歴史 学 に よ る 実証 的 研究 から 後 醍醐 天皇 ・ 南朝 の 正統 性 は それ ほど 強調 さ れ て い な かっ た が 、 明治 40 年代 に 入 り 、 南北朝 正閏 論 を 経 て 、 後 醍醐 天皇 ・ 南朝 の 正統 性 が 強 く 主張 さ れ て い き 、 それ に 伴 っ て 尊氏 に 対 する 否定 的 な 評価 が 確定 する こと と な っ た 。\\n戦前 の 国定 教科 書 に は 「 天皇 に 弓 を 引 い た 逆臣 」 と 書 か れ て お り 、 斎藤 実 内閣 の 中島 久万吉 商工 大臣 が 尊氏 を 礼賛 し た 文章 を 書 い た ため に 辞任 する 事件 も 起こ っ た 。\\n戦後 に な る と 、 国家 主義 的 な 歴史 観 が 大き く 後退 し 実証 主義 的 な 歴史 研究 が 進展 し た こと に 伴 い 、 尊氏 の 再 評価 が 進め られ た 。\\n佐藤 進一 に よ る 主従 制 的 支配 者 と し て の 尊氏 の 評価 は その 一 例 で あ り 、 これ は 武家 政権 に 関 する 研究 が 大き く 進展 する 契機 と な っ た 。\\n現代 の 歴史 研究 に お い て 、 尊氏 を 逆賊 と する 見解 は 存在 せ ず 、 むしろ 尊氏 が 逆賊 と な る まで の 経過 が 歴史 研究 の 一 テーマ に な る こと も あ る 。\\n文化 面 に お い て も 、 吉川 英治 が 昭和 30 年代 に 書 い た 『 私 本 太平 記 』 は 尊氏 を 主人 公 と し て い る が 読者 に 広 く 受け入れ られ て お り 、 尊氏 へ の 評価 が 戦前 の もの から 大き く 変化 し て い る こと が わか る 。\\n京都 国立 博物 館 所蔵 の 『 騎馬 武者 像 』 は 尊氏 の 肖像 と し て 一般 に 知 ら れ て い た が 、 2 代 将軍 足利 義詮 の 花押 が 像 上部 に 据え られ て い る こと や 、 騎馬 武者 の 馬具 に 描 か れ て い る 輪違 の 紋 が 足利 氏 の 家紋 で は な い こと （ 高氏 の 家紋 が 輪違 ） など の 理由 から 、 足利 家 執事 高師直 あるいは その 子 の 高師 詮 の 肖像 と する 説 が 有力 視 さ れ て お り 、 現在 で は 尊氏 説 は 否定 さ れ て い る 。\\n鎌倉 時代 に 藤原 隆信 が 描 い た と さ れ る 国宝 神護 寺 三 像 の うち 伝平 重盛 像 は 、 平 重盛 を 描 い た もの と 考え られ て き た が 、 1990 年 代 半ば に 美術 史家 の 米倉 迪夫 や 黒田 日出男 ら に よ っ て 尊氏 像 で あ る と の 説 が 提示 さ れ 、 広 い 支持 を 集め て い る 。\\n等 持 院 所蔵 の 尊氏 木像 と の 比較 や 、 冠 を とめ る 笄 （ こうがい ） が 室町 初期 に 流行 し た 形状 で あ る こと など が 根拠 と し て 挙げ られ て い る 。\\n広島 県 尾道 市 の 浄土 寺 に も 尊氏 を 描 い た と さ れ る 肖像 画 が 所蔵 さ れ て い る 。\\nその 他 、 江戸 時代 に 描 か れ た 錦絵 に 歌川 芳虎 の 「 太平 記 合戦 図 」 （ 尊氏 、 兵庫 ・ 福海 寺 に 避難 する 図 ） 、 橋本 周延 の 「 足利 尊氏 兵庫 合戦 図 」 （ 尊氏 、 兵庫 ・ 福海 寺 に 避難 する 図 ） が あ る 。\\nまた 、 現代 に な っ て 作 ら れ た 銅像 が
